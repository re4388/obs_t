# ch1 Accept Negativity
    
if you always think you need to be better, u are saying you are not good enough, this is negative thinking

if you ACCEPT your what ur current status, the negative, that’s paradoxically, a positive thinking (backward law) By accepting negative, you will be more good at dealing with necessary adversity Admit ur weakness, don’t give a fuck the unavoidable adversity, you will be unstoppable also, don’t give a fuck to everything since by giving the fuck to everything and you will feel you entitled to receive feedback and get all positive good, and which is impossible so in turn you will fall in to ”the loop of hell” (why no one give me a fuck that I deserved and then I feel bad and then I perform bad then no one even not possible to give a fuck….this is keep going downward spiral if I think I am just maintain by confident for the sake of being confident and not facing the ugly truth of many facets of myself) Why by giving a fuck to everything is related to entitlements? What's good on when we can learn to accept our own wrongness?
    
# ch2 HAPPINESS
    
begin with an interesting story on 佛祖 funny story living on rich and then poor and realized on how we shall see suffer itself. …

and he said, we can’t avoid suffering

if u have X, u suffer from having X,

if u don’t have X, u suffer from not having X,

pain and suffering are just part of our life

What Buddha takes on suffering?

We like think we can achieve happiness like algorithm: If we have… then we can achieve

but that’s not the case for happiness.

How our problematic culture told us on happiness (hint: algorithm)?

disappointment panda superhero story told us pain is useful, physically and psychologically, it’s biology

and we evolve to be a human that we always have dissatisfied minds to keep us survive ad improve, you just need to accept suffering itself, it’s not a bug, it’s feature

the solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one,

don’t hope for a life with no problem, hope for a life with good problem instead

problem never stop, they change and upgrade, happiness come from solving problem, the keyword here is “solving”

if you avoid, you become miserable,

if you pretend you don’t have, you become miserable

if you can’t solve, you become miserable

Happiness is therefore a form of action, an activity, not an event they you will find and happen to have

happiness is a constant work in progress, cuz solving problem is a constant working in progress, solving problem bred new ones

true happiness only occur when u find the problem you enjoy having and enjoy solving

two issue:

1. denial -> they deny reality, that delude, distant, they make them feel good in short run but they will know they are not solving the problem they hide in the long run
2. victim mentality-> they choose to believe there’s nothing they can do but they can, this make them feel high in short run and bad in the long run

What is the solution to the problem given that problems will never end? and what are two attitude facing problems which cause you miserable?

Why doing things?

Easy and feel good

high are unproductive and shallow, due to its nature, easy to do so

Whether u can know u are cheating yourself?

remember, u don’t feel happy if you need to tell yourself you are happy

high is like addiction and in moderate there’s nothing wrong with this, but the longer u numbs, the more painful u will need to confront the issue

emotion serve the single purpose as a signpost,

they are feedback mechanism

Negative feeling is a call an action, you are supposed to do sth, but it’s not mean u don’t think and go for it, but meaning u need to address it.

don’t do decisions making only based on emotional, this is like dog or 3-year-old kid behavior

Emotions are suggestions, observe them but don’t over trust them, u need to questioning them as well

also, don’t suppress emotions

this is a difficult pill to swallow: but there’s no such a thing we can do it then we get happiness. no such thing

If “what do u want for your life” is a wrong question, then what is the real question?

“what do u want for your life” is a wrong question,

the real question is

“What struggle you want in your life? “

“What suffer u want to have in your life?

What pain you want to sustain?

You want a great couple, u need to suffer…… do you?

You want a great salary, u need to suffer…do you?

You want to good at xxx, u need to suffer …. do you?

You want amazon body shape, u need to suffer… do you?

…..

happiness requires struggle

the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience, not salvation of it or avoid of it

author talk about he fantasy his rock start dream half of his life

and he found out he don’t actually life it

but he just fall in love with the result, the happy feeling on the stage, and he doesn’t enjoy enough the process, he hardly try hard and want to suffer from it

The common culture will say, he quiet, he doesn’t insist. No, he just don’t actually like it

How do you know you want to suffer from something?

(You want to suffer the process not the pleasure result)

"you are defined what you are willing to struggle for”

willpower is important, grit is important

np pain, no gain …blablabla…

But what you want to put ur wellpoint and grit and pain on?

it’s a never ending upward spiral, life will only get tough….suppose u are on the right path..

so what path u need to struggle and you need to have the joy in the climb itself
    
# ch3 Entitlement feeling
    
"entitlement feeling" make you forget what matter in life

談哪些現代有資源且自我感覺良好但卻沒有commitment, 沒有目標，隨波逐流的人。 a story about jimmy, believed in his own BS, bulletproof delusion a deadbeat, but hardly get him mad, and kind of fun with him merely feel good abt urself is not a good reason to feel good abt yourself you need adversity and failure to help you develop your strong mindset and achievement spent many time talking about how good he was but don’t do sth substantial it’s very hard to break them out all this come from some sort of self-esteem movement or new age stuff from 18xx to 19xx they feel they entitled the problem is they always need to feel good and the end up spending too much time thinking about themselves and take a lot of time conniving themselves you are good rather than facing real challenge and problems. the true confident is to know ur weakness “ yes i am still irresponsible to eat too much, yes, i am still bad at shaping my aps, and face this reality is the only way to begin to improve 假的自信就是需要自己一直告訴自己要有自信，空虛的， 真的自信就是知道自己哪裡不足，需要改進，但還是很弱，需要改進。 eventually the reality must hit so it’s just a question of when and how painful it will be

author describe his traumatic childhood and this expense made him feel entitled and he is needed to be love and become a player and screw up when he really met a girl he really liked. our child special make us kind of have a habit of self-aggrandizing and overindulgence this entitlement play in two way i am awaesome and rest of u such so i deserve special treatment i suck and rest of u all awesome so i deserve special treatment and switch these two mindsets 極端的邊遊走，我很厲害，我很慘，我都應該要有特殊待遇， 而網路激化效應、誇大化媒體效應、速成成功學文化效應，都導致了這個心理不健康現象 there’s is such thing as a personal problem, all problem had happened or having nothing new, you are just not special your problem is not unique internet age, we see everything and we feel more entitlement probability speaking, u just can’t exception on all aspects u need to be exception on one dimension when u invest tons of time on i that’s why some public start or people very good on one aspect but bad on another we are, for the most part, averge ppl we see everything on the internet or TV are just exception event, people’s one aspect, and if you compare with those exceptions, you may feel insecure, desperate, not good enough and we will need to compensate though entitlement and addiction via self-aggrandizing or other aggrandizing tech solve many problem but create this new psychological problem

Common thought said we all can be extraordinary or we deserve greater, in a general sense, this is contradictory. The rare people who do become exceptional at sth do no cuz they think they are exceptional, they are amazing cuz they obsessed with improvement. And that improvement stem from they believing they are not great, which is anti-entitlement. People who are very good at something are those people who also always think they are not good enough and they keep improving all the time. “everyone can be extraordinary and achieve greatness” like empty calorie get you fat, it’s ike big mac, you will feel tired and can’t move if you got lots of this kind of thinking. The health diet is about accepting the bland and mundane truths of life: your action actually don’t matter that much in the grand scheme of thins and the vast majority of life will be boring (compare to what you listen to the exception from media), and that’s okay. You will feel bad on this but once you accept it, you will no pressure and feel okay and no stress and anxiety to constantly needing to prove yourself, and your effort and energy will be located on the course, and then you begin to get things done and make things happened. You will have a growing appreciation for life’s basic experience: the pleasure of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, read a good book, laughing with someone you care about. Sound boring? That’s because these things are ordinary. But maybe they are ordinary for a reason: because they are what actually matter.
    
# ch4 value
    
Honda’s story, a JP soldier crazily stay in Jungle to hold on his value: defend the JP value(war time).When he back and he said he will not regret cuz that’s what he believe for. => that’s how strong the value can sustain people’s mindset and behavior Again, this told me, we shall not search for how we can avoid suffer, but what we need to know is what am I suffering and for what purpose(why). BUT finally, he went back and found out he world is change, the value is changed to new JP, which is not the old JP value he defend. So he feel depressing and finally move to Brazil till end of his life. => crappy value crappy life The self-awareness onion When u peel you will cry/suffer…haha the first layer you need to know is “understanding your emotion” we all have emotional blind spot and it takes year to know, which means u need to understand for what your current emotion is The second layer of self-awareness layer is an ability to ask WHY we feel certain emotion it takes yrs also to have the answer consistently and accurately To know the answer is important because it illuminate what we consider success or failure Once we understand the why, we can ideally do something to change it and there’s another deeper layer, this layer is personal value why do i consider this to be success/failure? how am i choosing to measure self? why i think this is the reason to make me angry? this layer takes constant questioning and effort to know.. but this is the most important one because our value determine the nature of our problem and the nature of our problem determine the quality of our lives Many people are horrible at answering this question accurately, and this prevent the from achieving deeper knowledge of their own value, they may say they value honesty and a true friend but they still conduct lie and manipulation to their friend Some guru ignore this deeper level of self-awareness and they take people who are miserable cuz they want to be rich and then give them many advice to be rich but ignoring the value-based question: why do they feel such a need to be rich in the first place? how are they choosing to measure success/failure for themselves? 誠實的問自己這些自我問題是非常酷難的，你需要一直對自己問這些基本的問題。 經驗上來說，通常越不舒服的答案，越可能是真的。 想一下有什麼事情讓你心煩 然後問你自己為什麼 答案是，這個會跟你的失敗有關。 然後問你自己，為何這個失敗對你來說很重要？ 有沒有可能這個失敗其實不是失敗呢？ 有沒有可能你用了一個錯誤的觀點去看？ 下面作者舉例他和哥哥的例子，例子說明： 價值假定：他認為兄弟本來就要親近 量測：他認為要頗快的持續回msg才表示親近， 再細問。 因為兄弟是家人，家人就要親近。 因為每個家庭都是這樣，這樣才健康和正常。 但難道不可以是只要互相尊重就可以？不需要可以一定要很快的回你msg

你對於價值的選擇和如何橫量，比客觀現實還要重要 ＝＝ 搖滾巨星被踢掉，換另一個band, 最後他組的團賣了好千萬張，非常成功，但是他還是認為他的人生是失敗的，因為他想要對踢他的那個band報仇，可是那個踢掉他的band更成功，賣出的唱片有好幾個億張。 人是動物演化的，因此有人就是會和人比，但我們應該要定義自己衡量自己的標準而不是和人比。 因為那個經驗讓他很痛苦，所以他報仇心態放不下來，所以和踢他的band的比賽就變成他衡量人生的標準。 ＝＝ 依照多數人標準，他已經是超級有錢人、高社會地位的大明星，但他覺得他人生失敗。 成功失敗的定義就看人自己定義。 If you want to change how you see your problem, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.

另外一個例子是Peter Bet, 他被Betle踢出去，一開始很沮喪也很失意，可是很多年很年以來後，他的訪談，他說他的人生很快樂? why 他被踢掉後，之後的幾年，他遇到他喜歡的另一半，結婚，生小孩，最後過著一個相對簡單的家庭～ 因為他的衡量人生的標準變了。 ＝＝ 價值有分好壞。 ＝＝ 壞價值 1.pleasure享樂 享樂、爽。 但這不是你拿來prioritize life的好選擇，你去問問吸毒、狂打電動、吃大餐很爽的人，現在生活如何 pleasure is a false god 研究發現追逐娛樂的人的比較心情不穩定，焦慮和焦躁。 please is easy to get and easy to lose 人生是需要，一定比例，但無果過量，上癮，就出現問題了。 基本上，pleasure 是happiness結果，但不是因 if u got stuff right, the pleasure will occur as a by-product 2.material success 房、車、錢等material possess 基本上你如果生活無虞後再加上一點財富後，更多的錢你會獲得得happiness是非常少得。 但更重要的是， Overvaluing material success is the danger of prioritizing it over other values, such as honesty, nonviolence and compassion, You measure ppl not by their behavior but by their status symbol, then you are not only shallow and probably an assholes. 3.always be right 我們基本上常常會有錯誤的假設和認知， 如果你把總是對的作為你的價值依據，那你基本上很困難去處理很多世界上的問題， 基本上，你會拒絕學習，因為你總是想要會是對的，那你也其實不需要去學習。 這種把「自己總會是對的」作為一種追求的價值， 反而會相信錯誤的認知陷阱和相信某種迷信中。 4 staying positive 把正面看待事情的能力，作為一種價值。 失去工作，好棒，可以追逐其他夢想。 老婆外遇，好，我認清這個人了。 小孩病死，很好，不用付學費了。 正面思考，有意義，但不是一個追求的價值。 因為生活會suck, 你心裡要保持健康，要接受負面的打擊和承認負面的事物。 讓自己哭、怒、傷心，正常的釋放。 拒絕負面情緒，就是延長的負面的情況，因為刻意支撐的正面情緒是逃避面對現實的負面問題，不正面解決問題。 面對負面問題，正確作法是： 你表達你的負面情緒，用社會可以接受的方式和一種心理健康的方式。 你表達你的負面情緒，以符合你價值的方式。 作者舉例， 他生氣的話他會表達出來，但是他不會打人（因為他相信非暴力） ＝＝ 跑完馬拉松 vs 吃很貴的大餐， 撫養小孩長大 vs 打電動打贏， 創業努力辛苦成功 vs 買昂貴的跑車。 前者這些活動都是高壓力，辛苦，且常常都不會是愉快的， 而且過程都是連接不斷的問題和困難，但是這些活動，是我們人生中更重要的活動和時光，這些活動一定都有痛苦，掙扎，甚至絕望，但一旦完成，我們會很高興且願意並且一直記得，且願意驕傲的分享給其他人。 Freud說， in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful pleasure, material success, always being right, stying positive都是不好的價值 我們人生重要的時刻，都不會是pleasant, 不會是物質獲取，不會是known, 不會是正面的。 這些，都是好價值下的side effect, 他們本身，只是empty high ＝＝ 好價值是 真實世界連接的，社會建設性的，立即且可以控制的。 壞價值是 虛幻的，迷性的、社會破壞的，無法困至且非立即的。 誠實是你可以控制的，反應真實，對其他人好的。 Popularity, 你無法控制，認知上的。 其他好的包括， 創新、主動幫助他人、自重、好奇心、謙虛、創意等等 壞的有，透過操控去壓制他人，暴力，歧視，總是自我良好，總是自我中心，總是不想要一個人，總是想要被大家喜歡，為了有錢而有錢等等 好價值都是可以內部的，而不好的價值都是需要依賴外部的。 ＝＝ 價值是有關prioritization 你對價值的判斷，絕對你優先順位的判斷，影響你去下決定，影響你的資源分配。 Onoda’s 的價值，讓他有這種很suck的life,,這就是價值的影響, crappy value, 或是那一位一直想要跟人比的有錢人。 當你有poor value, poor standard, you are giving fuck abt the things that don’t matter ,things that actually make ur life worse 當你選擇好的value, 我們可以diver our fuck to something better, toward thing that matter, thing that improve the state of our well-being and generate happiness, pleasure and success as side effects. Prioritizing better value, choosing better things to gave a fuck about and you get better problem and when u get better problem, you get better life 下面幾章會談幾個重要的價值

radical form of responsibility, take responsibility for everhtng that occurs un your life

uncertainty, the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own belief

the wiliness to discover your flaw and mistakes so thay they maybe improve upeon

rejection: the ability to both sat and hear no, this clearly defining what u will and will not accept in your life.

contemplation of one’s own mortality, this one is crucial, cuz paying vigilant attention to your own’s death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all your values n proper perspective.
    
# ch5 Responsibility
    
    hold every RESPOSIBILITY under all circumstance so, u always have choice to respond
    
    跑50 km 你是被拿槍逼，還是你是自己跑，感受天差地遠， 差在哪裡？是否是”自己”的選擇，很重要。
    
    when we feel we are choosing our problem, we are empowered, when we feel that our problems are being forced upon against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.
    
    有一個少年， 眼睛很差會短暫失去視力，站不直會驚巒，肚子很容易上度下洩.. 家裡算是有錢，可是人生一直都沒有順利過，無法正常上學， 家裡的兄弟姊妹都出頭天，連學校都沒畢業， 小時候都躲在家裡畫畫，但也畫不出名堂，沒人覺得他有才華， 最後爸爸靠關係讓他去哈佛醫學院念書，他覺得他更像是病人， 最後drop out, 然後逃離家人去amazon參加探險，他開始探險的第一天得到天花， 只好回家，還差點因為就gg回不到家裡， 他以前30好幾，他那時候在他的日記下了一個決定，他要做一個實驗:
    
    He’d spend one year believing for everything that he was 100 percent responsible for every thing that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the likelihood of failure.
    
    If nothing improved in that year, then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him, and he would take his own life. 這個人是william james, 三大心理學家之一，美國心理學之夫。 他最後說這個實驗是他的rebirth, and credit it as everything he accomplish in his life
    
    我們無法總是控制發生在我們身上的事情，但是我總是可以去選擇如何去選擇和控制發生在我們身上的事情的解讀和應對 就算你選擇說你無法控制，你也是進行了選擇 無論如何，我們總是都在做選擇，就算你不做選擇，你也做了一個選擇。
    
    所以問題在於what are we choosing to give a fuck about? what values are we choosing to base our action on? what metric are we choosing to use to measure our life?
    
    ---
    
    with greater power comes great responsibility, 反過來說，is more profound great responsibility comes great power 當你選擇接受更多的責任，你就會獲得更多的力量 接受責任，也是解決問題的第一步。 作者舉一個自己認為很矮的男人作為例子， 他總是認為因為自己矮所以女人不喜歡他， 就算他偶而出去約會，他也會把女人的一些行為解讀為讓為他自己因為很矮對方才這樣對他而自己告訴自己這個約會一定會不好，就算女人沒有這個想法 這種人選擇了一個錯誤的價值或belief而傷害他自己，就算他自己都不知道這個選擇。而他自然也會替自己的選擇而負責。 儘管他這樣做，他也會跟人說，他沒有選擇，因為他矮，女人就是膚淺。 這種選擇了crappy value 的男人自然沒有女人會跟他一起。 很多時候，resposbiliy 和fault 未必都一起。你撞到人，你要負責也是你的錯。 但是如果你家門口突然有一個嬰兒，你總要去處理，儘管不是你的faulit，但你需要去選擇如何處理，而你的選擇就會導致對應的resposibility
    
    ---
    
    法官也要去處理分配下來的案子，他們是沒有選擇可以挑到哪個，但是法官依照他們一定程度上的判斷、標準和尺度去進行判決的決定，也會需要負責。 根據你的行為而有些人需要去blame, 和你目前的情況的責任，這是兩件事情。 你今天不快樂，可以歸因於很多人的身上，但是沒有人需要對你今天的快樂負責。 因為， 你總是有選擇，去決定你要怎麼看。 你總是有選擇，去決定你要怎麼應對。 你總是有選擇，去決定你要選擇用什麼價值觀去看這個事情，和用什麼metric來看。
    
    ---
    
    作者提到他被女友拋棄，被披腿，因為他要他女友負責，,他更加的淒慘。 因為他無法控制他女友，不管他如何做。 所以，就算他淒慘跟他女友跟他分手有關，但他對他自己的淒慘要負責。 當作者開始了解到要對自己的人生負責，事情有所轉變， 開始運動， 開始回到正常的社交活動， 然後作者也發現當初他們交往，他也遠遠不是一個好的男朋友 他也不是絕對一個不是受害者，他也傷害他女友很多事情 作者學到，如果一個關係，你覺得對方很自私，傷害你， 你也不恍多讓，你只是不知道而已。
    
    作者的錯誤可以justify她的錯誤?不可以，但是作者承擔了責任 以後絕對不要再犯類似的問題，也要讓以後不要有類似的結果出現。 而這個淒慘的經驗，也是作者在感情上，學的最多的一個經驗。
    
    很多人會想要take resposibilty for success and happiness, 但更重要的是，對重大困難挑起責任是遠遠的更大重要，因為這是真正學習的開始。 要面對悲劇呢？也是你的責任？ 你被搶的反應呢？後續處理呢？心理層面上的思考呢？情感上的反應呢？ 你後續的經驗的處理和下一次的可能處理，都是你的責任。 作者提到Pakistan的Malala, 被Talinab臉部開槍，仍然相信她的自由， 她可以選擇跟很多人一樣，不出聲，會安全，然後跟大家說，她沒有選擇，因為壞人拿著槍說要殺我。但是她就是選擇不這樣做。
    
    ——-
    
    作者提到有一個commet 說作者不懂喪子之痛，罵他不懂。 作者反省，認知到這個網路作家的風險，他了解，進步，下次也會考慮這種人的心情， 他只會回說，I am sorry for your loss.
    
    提到OCD的治療方式： 類似怕病菌孩子一定要穿很多然後都無法出門。 一定要前後拍打的， 一定要隨時tap 地板的 第一步是讓孩子接受他們的現況，類似怕病菌孩子一定要穿很多然後都無法出門。 讓他知道這不是真的， 要他們接受這個現實，他們要接受他們這個不完美的強迫慾望。然後要知道，如果他們fullfill他們這個不合理的慾望，對他們的人生是有害的。 第二步是鼓勵他們去選擇一個更重要的信念或是價值，比他們相信的這個疾病的念頭更好：類似就是你其實可以出門而不用擔心病菌。 他們很痛苦的學習，改變，哭。 但是到最後，都有很多的進步。 I didn’t choose this life, I did’t choose this horrible, horrible condition, but I get to choose how to live with it, I have to choose how to live with it. 很多人跟這些OCD小孩一樣，天生有缺陷，基因不好，或是先天環境不好， 這是事實，這不是我們的錯，任何人的錯， 但是我們的責任要過的好。 ＝＝ 就跟play poker, 有運氣成分在，但好的選手，長期會贏的人， 他們就算拿到不好的牌，還是可以透過好的能力，好的選擇，增加贏的機率。 人生就是如此， 就算有運氣在， 都一直有持續進行好的選擇的人， 長期來看，人生就過的好。
    
    提到victimhood chic 怪罪的風潮 因為把問題怪在別人身上可以讓自己有一個temporary high and a feeling of moral righteousness 網路和社群網路的一個side effect強化這個現象 有人會覺得這很cool media 也喜歡種東西，因為比嚴肅新聞好做，散佈來散佈去，獲得注意，因為多人想要看，覺得看了很爽, pleasure 大家都覺得可以獲得某種關注，看的人也一起高興，憤怒的怪罪他人 不過活在民主和自由的時代，大家都可以表達自己的意見，聽到很多不同和不喜歡的聲音 這是活在這個時代的代價，可是大家好像都忘記了。 我們要對新聞和媒體有合理的質疑，對於反對意見給予更多的空間， 我們要把好的價值prioritize first, honest, fostering 透明度、welcome doubt over the values of being right, feeling good and getting revenge
    
    有人看了以上，問我 how do i change, 我的答案是：do or not do, there is no how 你總是在選擇，每天，每一秒， it’s really is that simple but not easy. 你如果真的改變你的vlaue, 會有很多side effect. it’s simple but hard. (Bill lee說過) 你會緊張 你會覺得uncertain, 因為你轉換value.. 這很正常 你會覺得失敗 因為你換了新的metric但還沒習慣 你的很多關係都會改變 因為你過去價值認識的朋友，你會換朋友，他們甚至會覺得你變了，不喜歡 以上，全部都會uncomfortable. As you reassess your values, you will be met with internal and external resistance long the way. More than anything, you will feel uncertain, you will wonder if what you are doing is wrong. But as we will see, this is a good thing.
    
# ch6 knowing you’re always WRONG to keep progress
    
    author take on his teenage EX always thinking he is right but wrong about some funny about thing washidon b.c, or told other i don’t care but actually i cared too much, or being to cool is to copy other, or thinking happiness is a destiny not a choice or activity or meet a girl and think will be last forever Every step of the way I was wrong about everything. Through my life, I have been wrong about myself, others, society, culture, the world, the universe, well, everything And I hope that will continue to be the case for the rest of my life And that will be a good thing, because that will mean I have grown. 你總是錯的，如果你沒有覺得過去的是你是錯的，你就還沒成長 或許，我們可以說這是錯誤法則。 總是錯誤法則=>一個檢驗是否有進步的方法 看看自己半年前，一年前，一季前，學一個東西前，看一本書前，體會一個經驗前，你錯了哪些，你會改變哪些，那些就是你進步的地方。 你錯的地方，就是你進步的地方。 以前的我太驕傲了，我說我不會後悔，是我臉皮厚。 錯的東西要改正。
    
    when we learn sth, we don’t go from wrong to right, we just go from wrong to less wrong and less less wong…and never approach perfect/right scientifically, our value is like hypothesis, and our action is experiment, the resulting emotions and patterns are our data. 也因為每個人都有不同的故事、目的、和環境，所以每個人的經驗都不同，而每一個人的獲得比較”少錯的”的人生經驗和進展也都只會不同，所以也不會有什麼perfect dogma and ideology可以適用在每個人身上。 ＝ 說到有的女生想要男生可是就是不會積極去找，有男生想要提昇職位但就是不會跟老闆要， 一種說法是他們害怕會失敗，被拒絕，其實不是 其實是，當女生想要出去做，他就需要面對它真正有沒有想要的beleif 當男生真的要去跟老闆談，他就需要面對它有沒有真正想要的意願和有沒有為了這個意願付出什麼然後去跟老闆談 因為，it’s easier to sit in a painful certainly that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciate your talents than to actually test those beliefs and found out for sure since chose the latter one you know you will going though suffering. woman will say i am not attractive enough and man said he is not talent enough or boss is an asshole, and we assume we are right, we assume we know how the story end and we don’t act. certainty is the enemy of growth. 除非做了，才可以確定，就算做了，也還是充滿討論空間。 價值判斷要持續保持懷疑的態度，才可以一直提昇和進步 -> more and more robust, mature Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we are wrong all the time. Because we are. 態度上，不要試著讓自己看起來都是對的，而要去留意和尋找自己還有哪些想法和行為有缺點可以改進。
    
    我們對於我們所謂正面的經驗和負面也要留意，如果前述， 很多負面的經驗也是最讓我們回憶的好經驗。 而我們唯一可以確定的就是當下的經驗，但這個經驗 are not worth much.
    
    如果現在開始500年後的人類看今天，會覺得很多面面都很可笑， 看我們如何使用電腦是如此的笨拙， 看我們如何看待科學是如此的錯誤， 看我們如何的文明上的人類互動式如此多的錯誤， 但他們也會是錯的， 只是透過500年的進步，錯的比我們少，
    
    作者透過一個心理學家的實驗，讓人進去一個有按鈕的房子，然後會ding, 然後讓人去辨識pattern, 每個人出來都有一套自己identified pattern, but 其實ding的憑率是隨機的 這個實驗是說明how our brain is wired. we can quickly come up with story/pattern to fill out the gap to explain the result even if there’s no anything true about it 因為我們人腦就是為了可以有效率的建立判斷關連性而wired的，而不是認定什麼是真和假的 在需要了解真實的意義上，這表示我們biologically基本上對於會互相建立因果和關連性，因此對於對錯真假基本上沒有什麼幫助。 另外我們自己建立一套關係和意義後，我們如果看到新的說法，我們也會很難去認定新的東西，而會用我們已經建立好的關係和意義去試圖解釋新的看法。 一個comedian Emo Philips說 I used to think the human brain was the most wonderful organ in my body, then I realized who was telling me this. 我們是一個非常容易有bias的思考邏輯去看事情，甚至就是透過建立各種bias去看事情 The result of this? Most of our beliefs are wrong. or to be more exact: ALL beliefs are wrong - some are just less wrong than others. The human mind is a jumble of inaccuracy. And while this may make you uncomfortable, it’s an incredible important concept to accept. new info is measured against the value and conclusion we already have and our brain is always biased toward what we feel to be true in that moment.

    # also there is treatment popular at that time as memory therapy (later one, thousands of therapists were sued and lost their licensee for this conduct) in an effort to achieve coherence, our mind will sometimes, in case of that, invent false memories. and during that period many innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence in the 1980s and early 1990s this is called “false memory syndrome”
    
    # There’s a lot of conventional wisdom out there telling you “trust yourself” or “go with your gut” and all sorts of please-sounding clichés.. but in light of this, perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less. maybe we need to question ourselves more if we are all wrong, all the time, then isn’t self-skepticism and the routines challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to process? This may sound scary and self-destructive, but it’s actually quite the opposite. It’s the only the safer option but t’s liberating as well.
    
    # author mentioned a crazy girl (very smart, IVY league and lawyer) keep finding him and want to married him after she had near-dead experiences and her insistence it’s cuz imagination god said, and her vividly said that. The author said, it’s a self-improvement junkie. She spends tens of thousands of dollars on books and seminars and courses. And the craziest part of all this is that her embodies all the lessons she’s learned to that she has her dream. She stays persistent with it, She visualized and take actions and father the rejections and failures and gets up and ties again. She’s relentlessly positive. She thinks pretty damn highly of herself. She claims to hal cats the same way Guess healed Lazarus. And yet her values are so fucked up so the none of this matter. The fact that she does everything “right” doesn’t make “her” right. There’s a certainty in her that refuse to relinquish itself but for some reason she can’t ignore it and she can’t stop.
    
    # 有關心理學犯罪學，有關 concept of evil 的研究 原本以為那些罪犯都是low-esteem, 但其實很多人都是高自尊，他們對於自己都是非常高的自信，也因為他們覺得自己是對的，所以有道理可以傷害和不尊重他人。 他們對於彼此的一些行為都有很高的自信這樣做肯定是對的，有很強的正義感，應該的。不管是racists, 宗教炸彈客，強姦犯，they believed they deserved this, entitled, very certainty.
    
    # 而有多人認為他們應該可以有伴侶，有更好的工作，他們的這種certainty 讓他們過的feel worse, they feel unappreciated and under acknowledge 然後他們這種心態又會導致行為上的自我破壞而進入惡性循環 it’s backward law again: the more u try to be certain abt sth, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know uncertainty removes our judgements of others, uncertainty preempts the unnecessary stereotyping and biases that we otherwise feel when we see somebody on TV, in the office, and on the street, uncertainty also relieves us of our judgment of ourselves, we don’t know we are loveable or not, how attractive we are, how successful we could potential become, the only way to achieve these is to remain uncertain of them and be open to finding them out through experience. uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth, the more we admit we not know, the more opportunity we gain to learn, the only way to solve problem is to first admit that our action and up to this point have been wrong and are not working the openness of being wrong must exist for any real change or growth to take place.
    
    # Manson’s law the more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it the more sth threatens to change how you view yourself how successful you believe yourself to be, how well u see yourself live up to your value, the more you will avoid ever getting around doing it Even it potential make your better, you will feel inherently scary making billion dollar could threaten ur identity just as much losing all your money people avoid writing his dram work of screen play cuz he would call into question his identity as a practical insurance adjuster she talking to his husband to be more adventure cuz the conversation would challenge her identity as a good moral mother …list goes. 我們的自我認知要有彈性，不然我們也無法改變。 我們會因為這件事情的認知和思考和行為有違背我的自我認知而討厭或是拒絕這些東西，但我們常常就就是自我設限而已。 there are good, important oppty that we consistently pass up cuz they threatens to change how we view and feel about ourselves, they threatens the values that we have chosen and have learned to live up to because despite dreaming about making a good living through X, the real potential of becoming X nobody like was far scarier than remaining an what you are doing now, the later is more comfortable. we have values to ourselves and we will try to live up to them and prove we had defend them, and we had biased toward them, as mentioned before. Until we chat how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and we are not.. we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety, we cannot change. In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous, it may cement you into a strip role, it may close your off to inner potential and outer opportunity. We say, don’t never think you know yourself, and this will let you remain humble in your judgment and accepting of the difference in others.
    
    佛教說要忘記自我，消融自我 let go the idea of “you” that arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you and thus you are better of letting go of everything, in a sense you could say that Buddis encourages ou to not give a fuck, 心理角度來說，這種思考有有一種幫助就是讓我們可以不會被自己設限，而可以讓自己自由和成長。 也許我真的不適合做x... then 他離開這個他一直無法滿意的x, 然後發展其他可能 有的時候我們會有自戀，認為自己的問題是個人的問題，很獨特， 建議是， 不要這樣看，不要定義自己為一個很窄和很獨特的框架內 the narrow and rarer the identify you choose for yourself, the more everything will seem to threaten you. 意思就是，不要總是認為自己特別聰明，很獨特，或是特別被某些人迫害， 意思就是，不要因為自己特別聰明或是特別被人迫害而認為自己總是應該得到什麼 也就是說，放棄這些維持你的emotion high 就跟吸毒癮的人一樣 (如果有什麼特別堅持，那可能就是你的突破點，不要吸那個毒了) 你會覺得很不舒服 但是當你習慣， 你會發現很多事情會開始好轉 ＝ 養成問我們自己困難問題的mental habit不容易 下面有三個問題可以隨時問自己， Q1: what if i am wrong, 如果我錯了呢？ 作者舉一他一個女性朋友結婚他哥哥一直無理由questioning 的例子 我們會因為觀察到世界和我們不一致的情況的時候發生負面情緒反應， 我們要學會去問自己這些反應會不會是因為我錯了，稍微讓我的確定性下降 the simple act of asking ourselves such questions generate the humility and compassion needed to resolve lots of our issue 不過當然不是說你問你自己就是表示你是錯的 問這個問題是為了可以讓你進入思考 你需要了解的是 如果你的人生需要改變，你一定要對自己目前的思考和行動的某種錯誤有種認知，不然你不會去改變。 除非你有辦法去問自己硬問題，然後找出哪裡出了問題，不然你的人生開始改變。 Q2 what would it mean if I were wrong, 如果我錯了這代表了什麼？ 這個問題會更painful, 這個問題是問更深一層，強迫我們去考慮，是不是另一個相反的，我不認同的價值，才是對的。 有辦法取看到其他跟你體系不相容的價值並且去思考可能是一個非常重要的技能，如果我們打算讓我們的人生過的有意義。 這個問題會很痛，所以有少人會去做到，因為這個會觸擊我們自己所相信的價值可能其實是BS Q3 would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than mu current problem, for both myself and others? 這是用來幫助測試我們想要挑戰的價值和困難直不值的繼續下去，而不是神經質的質問自己 目的是了解那一個問題是更好的問題，畢竟，問題永遠都只會一直不斷的升級下去。 而我們再選擇時，也要小心不是總是因為選擇簡單的路。我們要深刻的知道，除非你很清楚我們就是很容易這樣，你很難改變。我們寧願相信自己的價值而讓很多事情搞砸也不想要再mental上給自己非常不舒服的感覺，因為這就是我們大腦習慣的思路。 很多事情，當你發現只有你這樣想，很大的機率是你是錯的。這不是說你總是會無法比其他人可以更看清事情，這只是說，大多數的事情，你很難是比大多數的人的看清事情。 這是事實，你要相信，因為你相信，你也反而會有機會總是比別人看清事情。backward law

    對失敗和受苦的認知 對成功的認知 何謂是好的價值觀 locus of control Do soenthing principle 和背後的道理
    
    作者說他很幸運，因為他剛出社會工作，什麼工作都沒有，從最低層開始， 還欠錢，睡在朋友家的床上，因為這個幾個月的經歷，所以他對於換工作都沒有什麼好怕的，他很幸運有這個經歷。 同樣的，他家裡算是有錢，但是他家的錢都花在不好的地方，反而製造很多問題， 所以他很幸運的從很小的學到，有錢無法解決問題。 當他什麼都沒有的時候，他打算去自己創業，試試看有什麼可能。他很幸運，因為他什麼都沒有，所以他什麼都可以試試看。 這段跟Bill Lee的上下坡觀念一樣 ＝＝ 失敗和成功是一個相對的概念。 如果你的目標是成為一個面對網路自由的人，那你如果有一個很好的婚姻、家庭和政府工作，但如果政府違背這個目標，你會過的很痛苦。就像是Snowden 作者一樣是不喜歡被人說要做什麼，他喜歡自主，他喜歡自由，所以對他來說，放棄去一個公司工作而去試試看去創業，根本沒有任何的失敗。 他問自己一個簡單的問題： Would I rather make decent money and work a job I hated or go to trying internet entrepreneur and be broke for a while? If I try and fail in a few years and have to get a job anyway, will I have really lost anything? The answer is no. 如果價值是這樣，那沒有薪水，沒有去大公司工作，不是他的失敗，沒有去試試看，反而是失敗。 ＝＝ 畢卡索他從小到死前，都會這樣去畫畫。 請問你有時候事情，會一直這樣去做呢？ 畢卡索在餐廳的餐巾紙上畫畫，旁邊的人看到覺得很驚訝的好看，想要跟他要，他說要2千鎂，那個人覺得太誇張，這個只花你幾分鐘。他回說，這個花了我超過60年的時間。 Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you have failed at something. If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experience you have. 小孩學走路，會放棄嘛？通常都會努力失敗然後學習下去。 可是我們長大後學會放棄。 一方面來自教育上的問題，我們透過成績和處罰，讓我們自己告訴自己我們不適合然後放棄。 一方面來自去父母或是上面告訴我們要小心不可以犯錯，所以我們放棄試試看，因此就不會犯錯，也因此就不會失敗，也不會學習和進步。 一方面來自於媒體和網路讓我們看到很多成功的人的快樂和光明面，而我們沒有看到他們痛苦和許多次的失敗，而忘記失敗的重要性。 At some point, most of us reach a place where we’re afraid to fail, where we instinctively avoid failure and stuck only to what is placed in front of us or only what we are already good it. This confront us and stifle us. We can be truly success only at something we are willing to fail at. If we are unwilling to fail, then we are unwilling to succeed. We can be truly success only at something we are willing to… 你怕失敗的那個事情，你就不會因為怕失敗而不會去一直去嘗試，然後你就會真的失敗。
    
    成功失敗的定義如果由你的價值觀認定由外界控制，你就註定失落。 A lot of this fear of failure goes from having choose shitty value. (what your belief guide what you will do and what you will do lead to what kind of the result you will likely have. If you don’t think it’s okay, then change your shitty value) For instance, if I measure myself by the standard: make everyone I meet like me” I will be anxious, because failure is 100 percent defined by the actions of others, not by my own actions. I am not in control; thus, my self-worth is at the mercy of judgment by others. 這些shitty value的特色，基本上是都是我們完全控制以外的，由外在去決定的。 另外一些有問題的價值，就是如果我們解決了，那就會剩下空虛感 Better values are process-oriented, like express myself honestly to others, a metric for the value honestly. 每一個對話、互動、關係、交流，都努力達到真實。 This kind of value is ongoing, lifelong process that defies completion. 如果你的metric是買一個房子，賺多少錢，買一個好車，那你達到後，你會有中年危機，因為支撐你達到那個目標的動力已經消失，沒有機會讓你持續改進去達到，而持續達到的這個過程本身，就是讓你happiness的原因。 Picasso will not be able to produce and create things even at his last year in life if his metric is about become famous or making xxx money, he would stagnate and anxious at some point along the way. The reason he success is exactly the same reason why, as an old man, he was happy at scribble drawing on a napkin along in a café. His underlying value was simple and humble. And it was endless. It was the value” honest expression” in another form and this is what made that napkin so valuable.

    談自由、承諾 談人和人之間的關係 談不同文化 Author traveled over fifty countries and see many things, experience,girls,cultures It seems profound and also meaningless And finally he back to New York and have a place to live, wife and he realized that absolute freedom is by itself meaning nothing 絕對的自由表示什麼？ Freedom give you opportunities but itself can't give you anything and finally the only thing you achieve meaning and a sense of important is the narrowing freedom, rejection of many having alternatives and a commitment to a group and a person, things, belief and place 自由和承諾的連接為何？ On Russian culture on frankness and they have this culture cuz they need to know trust quick due to their history and western like to be nice because of economic culture Travel is a good chance to reexamine culture difference to see various workable values 作者體會一個旅行的好處為（跟我在巴西體會到的類似，餐廳外面）？ Only you invent yourself in a confined thing then you can achieve certain level of happiness and meaning The act of accepting one set of value meaning reject other alternatives Saying no is also meaning honesty and that's the key to our emotions healthy and relationships On boundaries issue Romance love begin from mid 1800 Many western romantic love is more like cocaine And the healthy love is rather stable and not that up and down as short highs They both shall be accepted their responsibility and can willingness to reject and be rejected by each other 作者如何看待西方浪漫戀愛觀念？ 什麼是界線問題？ They don't rely on each other Bad relationship either don't take they responsible or take other responsible This is also entitled mindset or shitty self-worth, think they can save other or shall be saved by other This is about all kind of relationships and sometime bad parenting lead to bad couple mentality Murky area makes you value never get you developing strong value Relationships shall be responsible by his own but be support Know the difference between obligated and want Limus test is to see if rejection lead to relationship change 戀愛的石蕊試紙？ You only can say This is your personal problem and you need to fix it and I will be supported For saver and victim this is how they feel their value come from and they need to change and surely, it's not easy 有問題關係中常見的兩種角色扮演為何？ If you have strong boundaries It's not about giving a fuck about all issue you partner giving a fuck It's about giving about you partner regardless giving fuck about This is what we called unconditional love It's not about giving a fuck about all issue you partner giving a fuck It's about what? On building trust He and his wife can say directly and that's trust If you say nice to get benefit that's not the unconditional love Occasion conflict is necessary and no one trusts yes-man Without negation also means no boundaries And conflict is not just normal and is absolutely necessary in and deep relationship Otherwise there is only manipulation 作者對於conflict跟錕一樣？ On trust If relationship don't have it and it's meaningless Cheating also need to be restore in a painful easy 關係中，失去信任後，有哪兩個要做到才可以回復信任？ You need to prove yourself you reexamine what and why your value overrides the relationship and you will need to take time to have good record to show you have change value And if you break this more and more time and like broke plate, you may fix it once and twice but you can't fix it many times because it's too shattered and into dust Freedom through commitment Consumer culture hope us want more and more and we have paradox of choice problem that we are afraid of losing other alternatives And you avoid choosing anything at all and keep option open and you avoid commitment 過度的自由追求會導致另一個什麼問題？ But as you know that you will never know something special unless you are in that area for a long while and you will never have some experience unless you have focus on something long enough Author said he focus all his energy and commitment to one thing for the past few year on writing And he found out it generates lots of thing and many new experience, so as he committed on one place and one woman 自由和承諾另一個違反直覺的地方？ It's counterintuitive and when you commitment of one thing, there is freedom and liberation on it. You will have more opportunities and upside by rejecting many alternatives No distraction, no unimportant and favirous things and make me focus and decision making easy Yes, breadth experience is necessary and you need to explore but you also need to know depth is where gold buried. this is true in relationships, career and a great life This is true, in everything
    
# ch9 and then we die
    
談死的意義 談優先順序 

He older admirable friend die due to some stupid and immature behavior and struck him to reject what the fuck his life is and will going out

And then he thought he just have to give a shot and what the fuck and author life turn out a better situation (if death is inevitable and what the fuck I am feel embarrassed and not to go that, no reason to do this because I am going to die and no reason to not to do this because I am going to die as well and since I am here and let's try)

Becker wrote denial of death Two point First, We are the only one creatures that can think abstract things, conceptualize,and think of pass and future and we will then have think of a world where we don't exist, we afraid die Second, we have a body self and a conceptual self and the reason we have the second one is cuz the first one will die and we do all we can to on immortality project that's why we have name on building, books, great achievement, and many influential people who have still very powerful after they long gone. Immortality could a value that if we can live up with it and we can have healthy psychologic state or if we can't then we will feel anxious. And we give a fuck on something to distract us from this inevatible reality, death. But there is another way, we can come to term with it, accept it, be comfortable with this fact, and then we can be more freely on our value and avoid traping in dogma view.

Author go to Africa the cape of god hope and he detail how he experience the near death experience when he keep approaching the cliff (this reminds me the question of how do you lose nearly 40 kilo and I had a realization in hospital which is also a near dead experience) Stoic though already teach us that we need to keep death in mind at all time and Buddhism also let us know meditation to relish our ego into nothingness as for prep for the death Mark Twin The man who lived fully is prepared to dead anytime What is your legacy given you know your will die which, by the way, the only known thing you know. And this is the most powerful prioritizer. And to accept the death you will need to have a value bigger than yourself and you will also dissolve the entitlements Your are already great if you have choose you want to go but cuz you didn't achieve app or company It's not just simple about,,自利或利他 but for when we facing the inevitable death, we need to have a value that bigger than our body-self and this value is immediate, controlled and tolerance of the chaotic world around us and this is where happiness come from, like being honest, being a contributing component of a greater entity...this is why people build good thing. Cell phone. Go to war. How do you set your goal when you know you will not be here anymore after 10 decades? What Becker two points on death? How you lose your 40 kilos? What Mark Twin, Greek Stoic school and Buddhism take on death? About die, what fact that is undebatable and inevitable? How do you psychologically accept the above fact?



翻譯


他的一位年長且令人敬佩的朋友由於一些愚蠢和不成熟的行為而死亡,這令他徹底否定了自己的生活。

之後他想,既然死亡是不可避免的,那就不管什麼"他媽的"都來一次試試看,看看會不會改變他的生活處境(反正我要死了,為什麼不試試看呢?我感到很丟臉,也不想去死,但也沒什麼理由做或不做,反正最終我也會死,既然我在這裡了,那就試試看吧)。

貝克爾在《否認死亡》中提出了兩個觀點:

首先,我們是唯一一種能夠抽象思考、概念化,並思考過去和未來的生物,我們會想像一個我們不存在的世界,我們害怕死亡。
其次,我們有身體自我和概念自我,之所以有第二種,是因為第一種會死亡,所以我們會竭盡全力去尋求不朽,這就是為什麼會有以自己名字命名的建築、書籍和偉大成就,以及許多即使死後仍舊影響力強大的重要人物。

不朽可能是一種價值觀,如果我們能夠追求它,我們的心理健康就會良好,否則我們會感到焦慮。
我們會陶醉於某些事物,以此來分散自己對這一不可避免現實的注意力,死亡。
但還有另一種方式,我們可以與之和解,接受它,對此感到舒適,然後我們就可以更自由地追求自己的價值觀,避免陷入教條性的觀點。

作者去了非洲好望角,詳細描述了當他不斷靠近懸崖時,他經歷的險象環生的情景(這讓我想起了我是如何減掉近40公斤的問題,以及我在醫院時的一種類似的近死體驗)。

斯多葛學派思想已經告訴我們,我們需要時刻銘記死亡,佛教也讓我們知道通過冥想來放棄自我是為了迎接死亡。

馬克·吐溫說,充分地活着的人隨時都準備好面對死亡。你留下的遺產是什麼,既然你知道你會死,這實際上是你唯一確知的事。

這是最強大的優先考慮因素。要接受死亡,你需要有一種比自己更大的價值觀,你也需要放棄特權意識。即使你沒有什麼成就,如果你選擇去死,你也是很了不起的。
這不只是關於自私或利他,而是當我們面對不可避免的死亡時,我們需要有一種超越我們身體自我的價值觀,這種價值觀是即時的、可控的,並且能容忍周圍混亂的世界,這就是幸福的來源,比如誠實、成為一個更大實體的貢獻者...這就是為什麼人們會創造好的東西,比如手機、參加戰爭。

當你知道你十年後就不在了,你如何設置自己的目標?

貝克爾提出的兩個關於死亡的觀點是什麼?你是如何減掉40公斤的?馬克·吐溫、希臘斯多葛學派和佛教對待死亡的態度是什麼?關於死亡,什麼是不可辯駁和不可避免的事實?你如何在心理上接受上述事實?
