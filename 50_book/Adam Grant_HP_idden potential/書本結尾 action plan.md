## **BUILD CHARACTER SKILLS  培養性格技能**

## **Unleash hidden potential through character skills.透過角色技能釋放隱藏的潛能。**

The people who grow the most aren’t the smartest people in the room. They’re the ones who strive to make themselves and others smarter. When opportunity doesn’t knock, look for ways to build a door—or climb through a window.成長最快的人並不是房間裡最聰明的人。他們努力讓自己和他人變得更聰明。當機會沒有來敲門時，尋找方法建造一扇門，或爬過一扇窗戶。

### **A. Become a creature of discomfortA. 成為一個不安的生物**

- Don’t be afraid to try a new style. Instead of focusing on the way you like to learn, embrace the discomfort of matching the method to the task. Reading and writing are usually best for critical thinking. Listening is ideal for understanding emotions, and doing is better for remembering information.

不要害怕嘗試新風格。不要專注於你喜歡的學習方式，而要接受將方法與任務相符的不適。閱讀和寫作通常最適合批判性思考。聆聽對於理解情緒是理想的選擇，而行動則較適合記憶訊息。
- Use it or never gain it at all. Put yourself in the ring before you feel ready. You don’t need to get comfortable before you can practice your skills—your comfort grows as you practice your skills. As polyglots show us, even experts have to start from day one.
  使用它，否則就永遠不會獲得它。在你準備好之前，讓自己進入擂台。在練習技能之前，您不需要感到舒適 —— 隨著您練習技能，您的舒適度會增加。正如通曉多種語言的人向我們展示的那樣，即使是專家也必須從第一天開始。
- Seek discomfort. Instead of just striving to learn, aim to feel uncomfortable. Pursuing discomfort sets you on a faster path to growth. If you want to get it right, it has to first feel wrong.
  尋求不適。不要只是努力學習，而是要讓自己感到不舒服。追求不適會讓你走上更快的成長之路。如果你想把它做好，就必須先感覺它是錯的。
- Set a mistake budget. To encourage trial and error, set a goal for the minimum number of mistakes you want to make per day or per week. When you expect to stumble, you ruminate about it less—and improve more.
  設定錯誤的預算。為了鼓勵嘗試和犯錯，請設定每天或每週要犯的最少錯誤數的目標。當你預期會遇到挫折時，你就會減少思考，進而提高更多。

### **B. Become a sponge 變成海綿**

- Increase your absorptive capacity. Seek out new knowledge, skills, and perspectives to fuel your growth—not feed your ego. Progress hinges on the quality of the information you take in, not on the quantity of information you seek out.
  增加你的吸收能力。尋找新的知識、技能和觀點來促進你的成長 — 而不是滿足你的自我。進步取決於您接受的資訊的質量，而不是您尋求的資訊的數量。
- Ask for advice, not feedback. Feedback is backward-looking—it leads people to criticize you or cheer for you. Advice is forward-looking—it leads people to coach you. You can get your critics and cheerleaders to act more like coaches by asking a simple question: “What’s one thing I can do better next time?”
  尋求建議，而不是回饋。回饋是向後看的 —— 它會導致人們批評你或為你歡呼。建議具有前瞻性 —— 它會引導人們指導你。你可以透過問一個簡單的問題來讓你的批評者和啦啦隊表現得更像教練：“下次我可以做得更好的一件事是什麼？”
- Figure out which sources to trust. Decide what information is worth absorbing—and which should be filtered out. Listen to the coaches who have relevant expertise (credibility), know you well (familiarity), and want what’s best for you (care).
  找出值得信任的來源。決定哪些資訊值得吸收，哪些資訊應該過濾掉。聽取具有相關專業知識（可信度）、了解您（熟悉度）並希望最適合您（關懷）的教練的意見。
- Be the coach you hope to have. Demonstrate that honesty is the highest expression of loyalty. Model effective coaching by being forthcoming in what you say and respectful in how you say it. Show people how easy it is to hear a hard truth from someone who believes in their potential and cares about their success.
  成為您希望擁有的教練。證明誠實是忠誠的最高表現。透過坦誠地表達自己的觀點並尊重自己的表達方式，樹立有效的指導榜樣。向人們展示，從相信自己的潛力並關心自己的成功的人那裡聽到殘酷的事實是多麼容易。

### **C. Become an imperfectionist 成為不完美主義者**

- Strive for excellence, not perfection. Progress comes from maintaining high standards, not eliminating every flaw. Practice wabi sabi, the art of honoring beauty in imperfection, by identifying some shortcomings that you can accept. Consider where you truly need the best and where you can settle for good enough. Mark your growth with Eric Best’s questions: Did you make yourself better today? Did you make someone else better today?
  力求卓越，而非完美。進步來自於維持高標準，而不是消除每一個缺陷。透過找出一些你可以接受的缺點來練習侘寂，這是一種在不完美中尊重美的藝術。考慮一下哪些地方你真正需要最好的，哪些地方你可以滿足於夠好的。用艾瑞克貝斯特的問題來標記你的成長：你今天讓自己變得更好了嗎？今天你讓別人變得更好了嗎？
- Enlist judges to gauge your progress. To figure out whether you’ve created a minimum lovable product, ask a few people to independently rate your work on a scale of 0 to 10. Whatever score you receive, ask them how you can get closer to 10. Be sure to set an acceptable as well as aspirational result—and don’t forget that to get high scores on your top priorities, you may have to be satisfied with lower scores on the others.
  讓評審來衡量你的進步。要確定您是否創建了最受喜愛的產品，請請幾個人以 0 到 10 的範圍對您的作品進行獨立評分。無論您獲得多少分數，請詢問他們如何才能更接近 10。請務必設置一個可接受且令人嚮往的結果，並且不要忘記，為了在您的首要任務上獲得高分，您可能必須滿足於其他事項上的較低分數。
- Be your own last judge. It’s better to disappoint others than to disappoint yourself. Before you release something into the world, assess whether it represents you well. If this was the only work people saw of yours, would you be proud of it?
  成為你自己的最後法官。讓別人失望總比讓自己失望好。在向世界發布某些東西之前，請評估它是否能很好地代表您。如果這是人們看到你唯一的作品，你會為此感到自豪嗎？
- Engage in mental time travel. When you’re struggling to appreciate your progress, consider how your past self would view your current achievements. If you knew five years ago what you’d accomplish now, how proud would you have been?
  進行精神時間旅行。當您努力欣賞自己的進步時，請考慮過去的自己會如何看待當前的成就。如果你五年前就知道自己現在會取得什麼成就，你會感到多麼自豪？

## **SET UP SCAFFOLDING TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES 搭建鷹架以克服障礙**

### **Look outward for the right support at the right time. 在正確的時間向外尋找正確的支撐。**

Every challenge requires its own support. The support you need isn’t permanent—it’s a temporary structure that gives you a foothold or a lift so you can keep climbing on your own.每一個挑戰都需要自己的支持。您需要的支撐不是永久性的，而是一個臨時結構，可以為您提供立足點或升降機，以便您可以繼續自行攀爬。

### **A. Turn practice into playA. 將練習變成遊戲**

- Turn the daily grind into a source of daily joy. To maintain harmonious passion, design practice around deliberate play. Set up fun skill-building challenges—like Evelyn Glennie learning to play a Bach piece on a snare drum, Steph Curry trying to score twenty-one points in a minute, or medical residents honing their nonverbal communication skills by using nonsense words in improv comedy games.
  把每天的苦差事變成每天的快樂泉源。為了保持和諧的熱情，圍繞著刻意的遊戲設計實踐。設立有趣的技能培養挑戰 —— 比如伊芙琳・格倫尼學習用軍鼓演奏巴赫的作品，斯蒂芬・庫裡試圖在一分鐘內得到二十一分，或者住院醫生通過在即興喜劇中使用無意義的字詞來磨練他們的非語言溝通技巧遊戲。
- Compete against yourself. Measure your progress over time, not against an opponent. The risk of competing against others is that you can win without getting better. When you compete against yourself, the only way to win is to grow.
  與自己競爭。隨著時間的推移衡量你的進步，而不是與對手的進步。與他人競爭的風險在於，你可以在沒有變得更好的情況下獲勝。當你與自己競爭時，獲勝的唯一方法就是成長。
- Don’t hold yourself hostage to a fixed routine. It’s possible to avoid burnout and boreout by introducing novelty and variety into your practice. You can alternate between different skills you’re practicing or switch up the tools and methods you use to learn those skills. Even small tweaks can make a big difference.
  不要讓自己受制於固定的例行公事。透過在實踐中引入新穎性和多樣性，可以避免倦怠和厭倦。您可以交替練習正在練習的不同技能，或切換用於學習這些技能的工具和方法。即使是很小的調整也能產生很大的不同。
- Be proactive about rest and recovery. Don’t wait until you’re burned out or bored out to take breaks—build them into your schedule. Taking time off helps to sustain harmonious passion, unlock fresh ideas, and deepen learning. Relaxing is not a waste of time; it’s an investment in well-being.
  積極主動地休息和恢復。不要等到你筋疲力盡或無聊時才休息 —— 將它們納入你的日程安排中。休假有助於維持和諧的熱情、釋放新想法並加深學習。放鬆並不是浪費時間；這是對福祉的投資。

### **B. Take the roundabout path to progressB. 走迂迴道路取得進步**

- When you’re stuck, back up to move forward. When you hit a dead end, it might be time to turn around and find a new path. It feels like regressing, but it’s often the only way to find a route to progress.
  當你陷入困境時，後退才能繼續前進。當你陷入死胡同時，可能是時候轉身尋找新的道路了。這感覺像是倒退，但這往往是找到進步之路的唯一方法。
- Find a compass. You don’t need a map to start on a new route—you just need a compass to gauge whether you’re heading in the right direction. A good compass is a credible source that signals when you’re going off course.
  找到一個指南針。您不需要地圖來開始一條新路線，您只需要一個指南針來判斷您是否朝著正確的方向前進。一個好的指南針是一個可靠的來源，當你偏離航線時它會發出訊號。
- Seek multiple guides. Instead of relying on a single expert or mentor, remember that the best directions come from multiple guides. Ask them about the landmarks and turning points from their own journeys—and tell them about the roads you’ve taken so far. As they drop pins, you can piece them together into a route that works for you.
  尋求多個指導。不要依賴單一的專家或導師，請記住最好的指導來自多個指南。詢問他們自己旅程中的地標和轉折點，並告訴他們到目前為止您走過的路。當他們掉落圖釘時，您可以將它們拼湊成適合您的路線。
- Find a side gig. When you find yourself languishing, you can build momentum by taking a detour to a new destination. When you make progress in a side project or hobby, you rack up small wins, which remind you that forward movement is possible.
  找一份副業。當你發現自己陷入困境時，你可以繞道去一個新的目的地來儲蓄動力。當你在副業項目或愛好中取得進展時，你會獲得一些小胜利，這提醒你前進是可能的。

### **C. Fly by your own bootstrapsC. 靠自己的力量飛翔**

- Teach what you want to learn. The best way to learn something is to teach it. You understand it better after you explain it—and you remember it better after you take the time to recall it. Like the Golden Thirteen, you can do this in groups, with each member teaching a distinct skill or slice of information.
  教你想學的東西。學習某樣東西的最好方法就是教導它。在解釋之後你會更好地理解它，並且在你花時間回憶之後你會更好地記住它。與黃金十三人一樣，您可以分組進行此操作，每個成員都教授不同的技能或資訊。
- Build confidence by coaching others. When you’re doubting your ability to overcome an obstacle, instead of seeking advice, try giving advice. Guiding others through a challenge reminds you that you have the resources you need to tackle it. The advice you give is usually the advice you need to take.
  透過指導他人建立信心。當您懷疑自己克服障礙的能力時，不要尋求建議，而是嘗試提供建議。指導他人應對挑戰會提醒您，您擁有應對挑戰所需的資源。您給的建議通常就是您需要採納的建議。
- Harness both high and low expectations as motivation. If ignorant naysayers doubt you, take it as a challenge. Instead of letting them crush your confidence, recognize it as an opportunity to prove them wrong. And when credible believers are behind you, rise to the occasion and prove them right.
  利用高期望和低期望作為動力。如果無知的反對者懷疑你，請將其視為一種挑戰。不要讓他們摧毀你的信心，而應將其視為證明他們錯誤的機會。當可信的信徒支持你時，要挺身而出並證明他們是對的。
- Be a good ancestor. When your faith falters, recall who you’re fighting for. Our deepest reserves of resilience come from knowing that other people are counting on us.
  做一個好祖。當你的信念動搖時，回想一下你在為誰而戰。我們最深的韌性儲備來自於知道其他人正在依靠我們。

## **BUILD SYSTEMS OF OPPORTUNITY 建立機會系統**

Open doors for people who are underrated and overlooked. Create systems that invest in and create opportunities for all—not just gifted students and high-potential employees. A good system gives underdogs and late bloomers the chance to show how far they’ve come.為那些被低估和忽視的人敞開大門。創建一個為所有人投資並創造機會的系統，而不僅僅是有天賦的學生和高潛力員工。一個好的系統可以讓失敗者和大器晚成者有機會展示他們已經走了多遠。

### **A. Design schools to bring out the best in all studentsA. 設計學校以激發所有學生的最佳潛能**

- Don’t waste a brain. Recognize that intelligence comes in many forms, and every child has the potential to excel. Cultivate a growth mindset in teachers, not only in students. Gauge success by the progress of every student, not just those at the top.
  別浪費腦子了。認識到智力有多種形式，每個孩子都有出類拔萃的潛力。培養教師的成長心態，而不僅僅是學生。衡量成功的標準是每個學生的進步，而不僅僅是那些頂尖學生的進步。
- Professionalize education. Following Finland’s example, train and treat teachers as trusted professionals. When teachers are equipped and encouraged to stay up-to-date on the latest evidence, coach one another, and shape the curriculum, the next generation can achieve greater things.
  教育專業化。以芬蘭為榜樣，將教師視為值得信賴的專業人士進行培訓和對待。當教師有能力並被鼓勵了解最新證據、互相指導並制定課程時，下一代就能取得更大的成就。
- Keep students with the same teachers for multiple years. Looping allows teachers to specialize in their students, not just their subjects. With more time to get to know each student personally, teachers can become coaches and mentors, tailoring their instructional and emotional support to help all students reach their potential.
  讓學生多年跟隨同一位老師。循環使教師能夠專注於學生，而不僅僅是他們的科目。透過更多時間親自了解每位學生，教師可以成為教練和導師，調整他們的教學和情感支持，幫助所有學生發揮潛力。
- Give students the freedom to explore and share their individual interests. The most important lesson to teach students is that learning is fun. When students get to select the activity stations, books, and projects that interest them, they’re more likely to develop intrinsic motivation. When they present on the topics they love, it reinforces their enthusiasm—and gives their classmates the chance to catch it.
  讓學生自由探索和分享他們的個人興趣。教給學生的最重要的一課是學習是有趣的。當學生選擇他們感興趣的活動站、書籍和專案時，他們更有可能發展內在動機。當他們談論自己喜歡的話題時，會增強他們的熱情，並讓他們的同學有機會了解這一點。

### **B. Unearth collective intelligence in teamsB. 挖掘團隊的集體智慧**

- Transform groups into teams. Collective intelligence depends on cohesion—aligning a team around shared responsibility for a meaningful mission. When people believe they need one another to succeed in reaching an important goal, they become more than the sum of their parts.
  將小組轉變為團隊。集體智慧取決於凝聚力－讓團隊圍繞著共同責任來完成有意義的使命。當人們相信他們需要彼此才能成功實現某一重要目標時，他們就會變得不僅僅是各個部分的總和。
- Choose leaders based on prosocial skills. Instead of promoting babblers and ball hogs, elevate people who put the mission above their ego—and prioritize team cohesion over personal glory. When teams are eager to contribute, the most effective leader is not the loudest talker, but the best listener.
  根據親社會技能選擇領導者。不要提拔那些喋喋不休的人，而要提拔那些把使命置於自我之上的人，並將團隊凝聚力置於個人榮耀之上。當團隊渴望做出貢獻時，最有效的領導者不是說話聲音最大的人，而是最好的傾聽者。
- Shift from brainstorming to brainwriting. For more balanced participation and better solutions, before you meet as a group, have people generate and evaluate ideas independently. Once all the ideas are on the table and all the voices are in the room, have the group select and refine the most promising possibilities.
  從腦力激盪轉向腦力寫作。為了更平衡的參與和更好的解決方案，在你們以小組形式開會之前，讓人們獨立地產生和評估想法。一旦所有的想法都擺在桌面上並且所有的聲音都在房間裡，讓團隊選擇並完善最有希望的可能性。
- Replace the corporate ladder with a lattice system. Instead of leaving it up to a single boss to shoot down suggestions, give people multiple paths to speak up. If people can go to more than one leader, a single no can’t kill an idea—and a single yes can be enough to save it.
  用格子系統取代公司階梯。不要讓一個老闆來否決建議，而是給人們多種表達意見的途徑。如果人們可以去找多個領導者，那麼一個「不」並不能扼殺一個想法 —— 而一個「是」就足以挽救它。

### **C. Discover uncut gems in job interviews and college applicationsC. 在工作面試和大學申請中發現未切割的寶石**

- Eliminate requirements for credentials and experience. When evaluating others, beware of mistaking past accomplishments and experience for future potential. Background and talent determine where people start, but character skills shape how far they can climb.
  消除對證書和經驗的要求。在評估他人時，請謹防將過去的成就和經驗誤認為未來的潛力。背景和天賦決定了人們的起點，但性格技能決定了他們能走多遠。
- Account for degree of difficulty. Struggles don’t necessarily reflect the absence of ability—often they reveal the presence of adversity. To account for the obstacles candidates have faced, put their performance in context by comparing them to peers in their school, major, and neighborhood.
  考慮難度。掙扎並不一定反映了能力的缺乏 —— 它們通常揭示了逆境的存在。為了說明候選人所面臨的障礙，請將他們的表現與學校、專業和社區的同儕進行比較，以了解他們的表現。
- Reimagine interviews to set candidates up to succeed.Instead of designing interviews to maximize stress, create opportunities for candidates to shine. Invite applicants to share what they love and showcase their strengths. Afterward, ask if they thought their performance represented them well—and if not, give them a do-over.
  重新構想面試，讓候選人成功。不要設計面試來最大化壓力，而是為候選人創造表現的機會。邀請申請者分享他們的愛好並展示他們的優勢。然後，詢問他們是否認為自己的表現很好地代表了自己，如果沒有，就讓他們重來一次。
- Use trajectories in evaluations. It’s not enough to look at recent or average performance—the trajectory of performance over time matters more. An upward slope is a clue that candidates have overcome adversity.
  在評估中使用軌跡。僅僅關注最近或平均表現是不夠的 —— 一段時間內的表現軌跡更重要。向上的斜率表示候選人已經克服了逆境。
- Redefine success. The most meaningful form of performance is progress. The ultimate mark of potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but the distance you’ve traveled—and helped others travel.
  重新定義成功。最有意義的表現形式就是進步。潛力的最終標誌不是你達到的頂峰的高度，而是你走過的距離 —— 以及幫助別人走過的距離。
