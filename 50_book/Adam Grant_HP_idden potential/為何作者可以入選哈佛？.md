- 作者申請成功進哈佛，他自己都不知道 why
- 他自己入學 writing class 一開始的考試過不來，自己懷疑自己根本不夠格
- 後來他問了 why 他可以入學
-   “John told me it wasn’t the magic that helped me stand out. \*\*\*\*
  - **It was the initiative I’d taken in teaching myself—and the courage I’d shown in doing an impromptu performance for him.**
- It was my first interview—I didn’t know we were just supposed to talk, and it was only after becoming an organizational psychologist that I realized I’d given him a work sample”
- When I failed Harvard’s writing test, they hadn’t declared me a failure as a writer.
- They’d failed a tiny snapshot of my writing. They didn’t know me, so I set out to prove them wrong.
- I was determined to go from failing the test to acing the class”
- and then 作者還是上了那個 writing class, 沒有去上初學班
- 他上的很辛苦，但是他超級努力 over come，最後他拿了全班唯一的 A






WeMo townhall 下午的活動，和 David 劉一組，我 see the attitude on he, like here, **the initiative to take to bootstrap himself and 影響到他人** 盡力。記住這些時刻。I appreciate the attitude 。
