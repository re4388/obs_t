- 多伊奇 真實世界的脈絡
    - 萬有之理
        - 還原主義是錯的，因為目前學科間的相依關係太粗糙，應該更有機，也未必是上下之分，怎麼組織要看如何解釋，不是目前簡單的方法和切法。
            - 一切都從初始狀態然後推敲，這樣也是非常的沒有解釋力。
        - 解釋很重要, 因此，工具主義和實證經驗主義都不足
            - 工具主義，預測不但是科學的工具，也是科學本身
            - 實證經驗主義，只認同實證和測試出來的，忽略”解釋”。
        - 解釋很重要，是因為解釋才可以make it work, 才可以統一更多東西，才可以進一步理解。
        - 如果科學進展的深度快於廣度，那萬有之理的一統就會比較清晰
        - 廣度的分支是必然，因為又出現需要了解細看的
        - 但是如果深度夠，分支又會變成沒有必要，因為A2就可以解釋過去的 B1, C1了

    - **Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems**
        - As organizations shift from monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices, distributed systems have become more fine-grained. But developing these new systems brings its own host of problems.
    - **Monolith to Microservices: Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith**
        - We will touch on many topics related to microservice architecture, but the focus is on the decomposition side of things. For a more general guide to microservice architectures, my previous book _Building Microservices_  would be a good place to start. In fact, I strongly recommend that you consider that book to be a companion to this one.

Recommendation: The Great Conversation, 6th edition, by Norman Melchert

- Hacking: The Art of Exploitation - I love this book. I've read it after I had a few years of professional programming experience with C#. It introduces programming via C, also every example program is disassembled with GDB. It gives the reader an intuition of how C code compiled and what happens on the register level.

But if you really want to understand how meaning is formed and what does it take to find your course in life, you should read The Evolving Self by Robert Kegan and/or To Have or to Be? by Erich Fromm.

The Evolving Self: Problem and Process in Human Development

To Have or To Be? (Bloomsoury Revelations) Paperback - June 27

- Grieve, B., The Blue Day Book: A Lesson in Cheering You Up, Kan
sas City: Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2000. This is a fun and
delightful book. Read it whenever you are feeling down (it's short).
- Hill, N., Think and Grow Rich, New York: Ballantine Books,
1. "Rich" doesn't only mean in money—it means in whatever
form you want to be rich in. This book has had a profound impact on
both my personal and business success.
[cheat-sheets/think-and-grow-rich-cheat-sheet: Most interesting ideas from Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill](https://github.com/cheat-sheets/think-and-grow-rich-cheat-sheet)
- Kundtz, D., Stopping: How to Be Still When You Have to Keep Going,
Berkeley: Conari Press, 1998. As a recovering workaholic, this book
is a beautiful reminder of how to slow down and enjoy life, but still get
things done.
- Mandino, O., The Greatest Salesman in the World, New York: Ban
tam Press, 1968. I read and "practiced" this book a few years ago. It
has helped me live my life the way I've always wanted to. If you read it,
I strongly suggest doing what the scrolls tell Hafid to do—not just read
about it (you 'II know what I mean when you read the book).
