    - a habit to use engineering way to approve this technology solve, not only learning but also know what particular problem it can help to solve. Queue system is a good example

    - on coding, copy and paste:
        - 多 recall, even for code, try to give you some time to recall to write code and to write command
        - if you are sure you forget or probably wrong, after fail, double check and learn again
        - but don’t just copy/paste and not do the recall process
            - if you always copy/paste and don’t recall, you will not learn thing
            - and in many case, copy/paste if not going to work
- 看書、筆記重要
    QEC 找 question, event, and conclusion

    - about growth mindset
        Know about the growth mindset
        Don’t be fool by traditional talent based mindset
        Use different perspective, different brain brain to learn to facilitate learning
        Discuss with other is using other part of brain area
        On code or programming
        Read code
        Write code
        Discuss code
        Try different way to work on the same coding problem

    - previously i am slack on many things except company stuff and my skill
    - But given two reason I might need to change my strategy
    - One. 用進廢退
    - Two. I get used to the attitude and use subconsciously in my work or important things
    - New way to do things. Always think more and pay attention on all things and serious about cut down something unimportant to not spend time on it

    - 看深一點，還有很多都是 typescript and node.js but you don’t understand!!!
    - 看多一點 node.js, typescript code, try to understand as much as You can!!!
    - 我覺得 vim 作為局部，已經很清楚要知道要做什麼事情的時候，很有幫助。
        - 但是如果你還在探索，那可能還是需要用到滑鼠
            - since… still there’s a lot of activities you can ONLY do w/ mouse
            - a lot of system CAN NOT go with VIM binding
                - and will never have
            - even in editor, it’s not make sense to have all actions using keyboard…too much keybinding
- 2023-04-21
    - I go to trending website to see if any interesting framework and I would like to check the source code to learn something interesting…
    - However….. I think every domain has its own set of mechanism of doing things… so Like I see the AutoGPT impl, it use command kind of pattern, and he use remix as its frontend..
        - The problem is… I am not dislikeing the command kind of mechanism…but…not that interesring which would lead to go down the rabbbit hole…
        - also, I kind of not wana learn something related to froendend framkework for a moment…so I will also pass remix
        - as a result, this is also soso project to let me…

    如何讓技術變好？
    <https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-get-experience-as-a-software-engineer>
    
    Here's the secret: More Problems, More Experience
    
    "Technical Experience" comes from experiencing different situations 
    and then learning from those experiences to improve your own response to the same or 
    similar situations in the future. Another way to say "situations" is "problems."
    
    Engineers who make the most of their "experience time investment" are the ones 
    who intentionally expose themselves to various software related problems and 
    then work hard to overcome or find/build solutions to those problems.
    
    So when you're looking to increase your own level of technical experience 
    (and increase the return on your time investment), look for "problems."
    
    Where can you find problems?
    Work and Open Source.
    
    Like: "There's some bug in this library" or 
    "this test is flakey" or "when we deploy our app, we get a spike of 500 errors." 
    These kinds of problems are all over the place and require some deep digging into the code 
    to figure out what's going on.
    
    Another thing you can do is be the go-to person for problems of a certain domain that you want to improve on. 
    You want to be the "XXXXXXXXXX expert" at your organization? 
    Do some research, and give a talk internally at your company. 
    Invite people to ping you with questions. 
    The more questions you get about the topic, 
    the more varied problems you'll be exposed to, 
    and the more digging you'll have to do. It's a cycle.
    
    Author experience
    One of the first libraries that I worked on was angular-formly 
    and I got into it because there was a feature that didn't exist that I needed. 
    I could have passively moved on to another library to fix its capabilities to my app.
    Instead I looked through the code to see that what I wanted was possible, 
    then opened an issue, followed by a pull request.
    
    You develop more experience as you bump against and solve varied problems. 
    Your brain is a muscle and it gets better at solving similar problems the more 
    it's exercised in a certain way.
    
    ＝＝
    
    good learning turotial matter, I think I need to spend more time on very very good
    materil! Life is short and your need to get mastery as soon as possible,
    so don't waste your time on no-good-enough material! 
    forget bad thing is more harder than learn new thing, so try to learn the best
    material at begin
    
    people network is still very important.
    
    不管是自己定的目標，還是社會期許應該要達到的目標，不管是什麼目標，
    人生總是不斷的往下一個目標前進，
    不過我們應該不要被目標給綁架，要學會享受路邊的風景，
    所謂心靈的自由，可能就是這麼一回事。
    
    算不清楚的舊帳會累積成漲不上去的工資 
    應付和主動成長 往往就在一念之間
    
    所謂技術人員的核心能力 
    不是會了別人不會的技術知識點 
    而是能解決別人解決不了的問題
    
    技術大牛不忌諱分享自己的經驗和想法 
    因為他知道 沒人能靠著想法上市 
    市場上做不缺的就是想法 最容易被偷的也是想法 代碼可以偷 插件可以搬 
    但是解決問題背後的思維 就算明明白白地分享出去 
    再聰明的人也得經歷項目實戰和時間和經驗的積累，
    才可以理解通透，形成解決問題的能力

    -> 轉移注意
    -> use action no word
    -> don't say NO
    -> don't say if you on angry state
    -> what you do will become what he do
    
    Algo 實際上就是在鍛鍊你的大腦少做"不應該的大概懂"
    
    Algo題目的思維到實做的gap有時候很大，用看的都會"看懂"
    真的去寫，都做不出來。
    甚至你思維的部分都已經可以跟當初學的時候，全部
    的概念都到位了，還是實做一直出問題。
        - 這個考你要不要做到 “ clear understanding” 的程度
        - 還是已經習慣了 “大概懂”的這種錯誤的觀念
        - 有些東西可以”大概懂” 因為資訊/知識浩瀚無涯且時間有限
        - 有些東西你要有辦法”recall” 要"夠懂"不是”大概懂”
    
    don't just keep 說教和 arugment, just make other no feel good!

    「I won’t be wading in early,” Teddy said. “Too many friends. But I can tell you this, Barack. The power to inspire is rare. Moments like this are rare. You think you may not be ready, that you’ll do it at a more convenient time. But you don’t choose the time. The time chooses you. Either you seize what may turn out to be the only chance you have, or you decide you’re willing to live with the knowledge that the chance has passed you by.」

    How Brain taught me to solve the jest failure test bug
    1. I can simple console.log to know where the bug really located at which line, at which call, at which operation
    2. be more patient, look into details, see how many options I have and be patient and look into
    
    ========
    
    I hate this feeling......:
    everytime, I think I might make it better, I choose not to do it cuz this is not the default setting..
    and later on, the senior ask me to do so..
    
    I don't like this cycle cuz it require me to go back to update many exist code
    it involve rework
    
    and the main reason I hate it is cuz I know how to don better  but I slience and not choose to ask to do it?
    
    Even I have hestitate of any side effect for doing it, I shall be easily ask first to know it.
    
    Next time, Ben, you should try to go for waht you think is best for all you can do.
    If you have doubt, you can just ask in advance and then you can do it.

    一个伟大的数学家不会用漫长而无聊的方法来解决问题，因为他会看到隐藏在问题背后的模式，然后应用这些模式找到答案。在计算机科学领域也是如此

    What is 學習?
    a process of 透過例子找出問題和答案的規律
    
    What we always wrong on learning in the first step?
    明確什麼是問題?
    Even, if our frame of question could be better?
    
    What's the common misconception of learning?
    記住了知識的描述, aka info, 但是 info 不是 Knowledge, learning is not just know the info
    
    How to learn? A tip?
    1. 把知識和例子分開來看
    2. 盡可能的蒐集更多的例子, to 盡可能的體會問題和答案之間的關係。
    3. Overtime, we can compress those example/info into Knowledge。
    PS:
    這就是所謂的先把書讀厚，再把書讀薄的意思。
    Also, 學習是為了可以解決新問題，因次學會的知識也要可以驗證，是否可以描述新問題和新答案間的真正關係。

    ## Go for depth in areas you love and learn solid fundamentals
    ## know its concept and have a idea on how to relate to exist knowledge
    
    when you learn code concept, you need to know its all aspects of its logic, not just the syntax.
    
    when you want to make a point (say a bug report), don't know unrelevant issue, make your pt clear.
    don't show stuff that don't have corelated,, if you can't find pattern point to that, don't show that, it let stuff less clear, add uncessary complexisty
    don't need to show the investiagte history/jpunrty, show the key result and related evident
    
    Just like when you need to write algorithms, when you write rather complicated logic in code, you need to have "crystal clarity" on what input and outputs ( contract) , write them down, drawing them...make contract very clear first and then write function. O.W. it's waste of your time.
    
    CHILD CARE is tired and you can't imagine, DO NOT SAY AGAINST ABOUT IT
    
    It’s powerful to covey harsh stuff in pline tone, but it still hurt. Think triple before do it. Try use encouragement and supportive logic to persuade.

    monami still and find 2 places to increase simplicity
    1. try to integrate the third queue if the cost is not high, the increased simplicity might jusitfy -> worthy to try
    2. not only resuse the method, you can also resue the logic inside the method. i.e. the loadData and successCallBack example

    Ray Dalio Principle
    1. 你需要從**你自己的角度**去看清楚什麼是**真實**
    2. **這個真實**是作為要產生**好的結果**的**基礎**
    3. 夢想＋真實＋決心 = 一個成功的生活  （成功的定義由你自己決定，因為什麼是真實已經由你決定）
    4. 他定義這個是**hyper realist**
    5. **痛苦**＋**反思** = **進步**
    6. 人生前進（不斷發生的）五步驟：**獲取目標→識別問題→診斷分析問題找出根因→設計解決方案→執行這些方案**
    7. 任何事情都有一個不斷反覆的模式，我們天性容易**忽視長期模式**。
    8. 兩個最大的障礙（來自我們大腦的運作）：**自我ego** 和 個人**盲點** 
    9. 解決方法：**極端開放心態** radically open-minded
    10. struggle well, **享受旅程**：成功最大的收穫不是果實，而是流汗過程中的那些成長。

    Clean code and architecture is compatible with human nature, ease human read, ease maintain cost, sustainability, eco.
    
    Learned from Monami:
    always need to find way to elimite duplicate code,
    duplicate code meaning, you need to change two place in the future, 
    don't duplicate logic, make the same logic only happen once and you don't need to refactor the same logic in two place!!!

    賺錢應該取決於你是誰和你喜歡做什麼
    你的個性和你的興趣
    這樣你才能發揮你的個性
    你擁有熱情和興趣，有足夠動機，也可以堅持下去
    
    行動的三個組成
    動機 （透過探詢 why, 自己的感覺）
    能力 （透過分解，簡單時間表）
    觸發 （透過 todo list, 通知）
    
    要想發財，你需要槓桿。
    槓桿來自於勞動力、資本，也可能是通過代碼和媒體。
    其中的大多數，如勞動力和資本，都來自於他人的給予。
    譬如說，勞動力，必須是有人願意跟隨你；對於資本，必須有人給你錢或資產來讓你管理和使用。
    所以要得到這些，你必須建立信譽。因此，你必須盡可能以自己的名義去做！
    
    當然這也是有風險的，責任是一把雙刃劍，它能讓你在事情順利的時候收穫信譽，在事情糟糕的時候承受失敗的衝擊。

    ***
    Don't forget one of the reasons you want to be an engineer:  practice `the step by step logical and rigous mind and solid logic thinking and thinking attitude or meta thinking on this regard.  Don't rush out tutorial and feel seems know but actually not. Just *really* *really* got it unless you know it's not worthy. 
    ***
    
    ***************************
    1. 直接練習真實世界要做的事情
    (不要因為怕失敗，一直一直龜在簡單的練習例子中
    進去做沒那麼難，多數人都是怕
    要養成敢於很快進入真實案例的心態)
    2. 用技術去作自己覺得有意義的東西
    3. 不要學，一定要做出來。
