since machine only can store in 1 or 0
we approx. 10 to 2 in number system

| 單位  | 10的幾次方 | 2的幾次方 |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| 1kb | 3      | 10    |
| 1mb | 6      | 20    |
| 1gb | 9      | 30    |
| 1tb | 12     | 40    |
| 1pb | 15     | 50    |


估算：
1 byte(8 bit) is the size for a 1 ASCII character
