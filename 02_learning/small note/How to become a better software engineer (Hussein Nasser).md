 - Like sports, practice make perfect
-  in programing, write more, build more, solve more problems
- learn the first principle, before checking answer
    - write from the scratch on my own 
- The learning process is all about learning what I do not know before
    - check answer directly will not uncover unknown unknown    
    - Think About the question and don’t look/search for the answer at beginning!!
    - To identify what part I don't know
    - a degree of uncomfortable and confusion is learning process
    -  [[不要馬上問人]]
