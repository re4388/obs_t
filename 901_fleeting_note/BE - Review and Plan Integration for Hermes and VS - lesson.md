[[_wemo_tickets]]


---


how this happen
- plan in a wrong direction
- can not present out the desired outcome when the time is arrived, why? since I am ~ 0 knowledge before this ticket
	- I take time to...
		- check 2 ori docs
		- understand current API
		- ask a lot of questions


how to prevent next time
- plan in a wrong direction -> you know more on how to plan, begin with use case , see [[core system 功能規劃記錄]]
- can not present out the desired outcome when the time is arrived -> speak out that your are not familir and shall not be able to achieve it around 2 days 



other thoughts
- no free lunch, if Josh is like Mike, can know I may not be able to plan out and then becoming fix me in a wall
	- -> then he will not ask me to do this
	- -> then I will not have learned this lesson and know a lot more about core system
