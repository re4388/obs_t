# 學會如何快速學習

最好的做法是學會如何快速學習

以及如何將這些學習應用於解決雇主想看到解決的問題。

這需要經驗,對我們每個人的速度都不同,

但

**有一天你會發現自己比比你資歷淺很多的人學習更快,這就是你達到了目標的時候**。

但是,**學習永遠不會結束**。


# 有目的地的學習

新技術層出不窮,隨著你越來越有經驗,你會開始做出更有影響力的決策,但你仍將一直在探索新的技術、框架、資料庫、框架和程式語言。

在最有影響力的公司中最成功的工程師也一直處於不安之中,因為他們必須了解自己不了解的事物;

他們只是變得非常擅長處於不確定狀態、快速學習、誠實、脆弱,並做出明智的判斷。

**不過,你必須對事情有目標意識。

**這不是關注於獲得工作的東西,而是關注於擴展知識,並思考你所學到的東西與你之前學到的其他東西之間的關係。**

開始就你最擅長的事物形成"專業"意見,並與朋友分享。

**討論事物並辯論其優點。為什麼人們喜歡某些東西?**

**技術X的問題是什麼,而Y如何真正解決**

**它?是否有替代方案,它們的權衡是什麼?**

培養對某事的熱情,了解他人如何提高標準,以及這個話題有多深。

為 Terraform vs CDK 或 JavaScript vs Python 爭論。


# 至少掌握技術領域內的3種技術是值得的

例如,學習3種程式語言。

學習3種Node.JS框架和3種Python框架。

了解3種不同資料庫的工作原理,並思考它們的不同之處以及適用於不同用例的原因。

使用3種IDE。

作為開發人員,熟悉Linux、MacOS和Windows。

使用3種不同的Linux伺服器發行版,並**弄清楚它們的不同和相似之處**。

你不必成為這些全部的專家,但在每項技術上自己動手建構東西,而不是依賴教程,將使你取得更大進步,並迫使你真正理解你正在做什麼以及它與你已經學習的其他事物的關係。

**你會發現,你知道得越多,學習新事物就越容易,因為你可以將經驗串在一起。**

你的計算機科學背景應該使所有這些都相當容易,所以不要忘了利用你學到的基本原理,並深入研究硬核技術文檔,

同時避免毫無價值的"名人"(YouTube/LinkedIn)場景,這些只是娛樂,似乎很有用,但實際上只是零食和舒適食物,因此並不是很有教育意義。

**實際動手操作 > 其他一切。**

我知道這太多了,所以這裡有一些更可操作的建議:

在工作中,看看你的同事使用不同技術在做什麼,並閱讀一下那些技術,然後詢問是否可以與他們坐在一起幾個小時來了解它的工作原理以及他們如何使用它。

然後,如果你有機會將工作交接給別人,但他們沒有時間,向你的經理或團隊負責人提議你自己來處理這個任務,以便應用你的知識,並比等待其他團隊有時間更快地交付價值。「這不是我的工作」應該成為你再也不能說出口的話。


在空閒時間,做一個包含你熟悉的所有技術的電子表格。

將它們分類和分組,然後查看表格,並試著確保你對每個分組都有3種技術的經驗。

學習什麼並不重要,只要你學習了某些東西;

**再次,你的目標不是為了工作機會,而是為了能夠快速學習。**

但如果你需要確定優先順序或在某些事物之間做出選擇,**

請嘗試最「陌生和不舒服的事物**(一種陌生程式語言的新後端框架,在一個你從未使用過的作業系統上),

或你朋友有經驗的事物(如果你遇到困難,絕對不要問他們問題!!!!!)。

**嘗試製作你需要或想要的東西,或與你的愛好或熱情相一致的東西;**
**愛好或熱情永遠是促進工程velocity的最大動力。**
**如果你沒有這樣的焦點,只要做你喜歡的事情;**

在空餘時間工作應該很有趣,這樣你就會興奮地去建造東西 - 學習是一種副作用。

這個策略可能很困難,但你稍後可以根據需要進行調整。

再次強調,不要擔心使用哪種技術。它並不重要。

只要學習東西,並有目的地去做。


# 這一切都在於你能夠使用各種工具來解決與業務目標相一致的問題,以及你能夠在面試過程中向別人展示和說服你擅長這一點


**你知道為什麼技術並不重要嗎?因為10-15年後,任何潛在雇主都不會在乎你知道哪些框架。
他們只想知道你是否能將任何技術應用於解決他們的業務問題。**

現在人們似乎很在乎的原因,只是因為你還是初級,目前沒有期望你能做到這一點,所以技術專注是一種更方便的招聘方式。

**但實際上,這一切都在於你能夠使用各種工具來解決與業務目標相一致的問題,**
**以及你能夠在面試過程中向別人展示和說服你擅長這一點。**


再提一點建議:

在工作一年內不要專注於職業發展。專注於做好工作並改善事物。在一家不太好的小公司裡工作5年以上,那裡有很多需要改善的地方,也有你失敗但也能產生積極變化的空間,要比在一家更大的公司裡隱形工作,有更好的薪酬但沒有改變和成長的空間要好得多。

但不要接受有毒的工作環境,所以要麼就為任何其他地方辭職,要麼就提出你的擔憂,並與同事們一起努力產生改變。


# 原文


The best thing for you to do is learn how to learn quickly, and how to apply those learnings to solve problems that your employer wants to see solved. 

That comes with experience, it's a path that's different in velocity for all of us, but one day you'll notice that you're much quicker at picking something up than someone years more junior than you, and you'll then know you're there. 

But you'll also know that learning is never over. There's new tech all the time and as you get more experienced you will start making more influential decisions, but you're still going to be exploring new technologies, frameworks, databases, legislative frameworks and programming languages all the time. 

The most successful engineers at the most high profile companies are uncomfortable all the time as well because they always have to know things about things they don't know things about; they've just gotten really good at being uncomfortable, learning quickly, being honest and vulnerable, and passing good judgment.

==


You've got to be intentional about things, though. Not in terms of focusing on the things that get jobs, but rather in terms of focusing on things that expand knowledge, and reflecting on what you've learned and how it relates to other things you've learned. 

Start forming "professional" opinions about things you're best at and share them with your friends. Discuss things and debate the merits of things. Why do people like things? What are the problems with technology X, and how does Y really solve it? Are there alternatives, and what are their tradeoffs? Build a passion for something and see how others have raised that bar and how deep that rabbit hole goes. Get into a fight about Terraform vs CDK or JavaScript vs Python.

===

It's always worth it to be comfortable with at least 3 technologies in a technology domain. For example, learn 3 programming languages. Learn 3 Node.JS frameworks and 3 Python frameworks. Learn how 3 different databases work and reflect on what makes them different and why they're good for different use cases. Use 3 IDEs. Get comfortable as a developer with Linux, MacOS and Windows. Use 3 different Linux server distributions and figure out what's different and similar. You don't have to be an expert with all of these, but building something yourself on each of these technologies without leaning on a tutorial will get you so much further and forces you to really understand what you're doing and how it relates to the other things you've already learned. You'll see that the more you know, the easier it is to learn new things as you connect experiences together.

Your background in computer science should make all of this fairly easy, so don't forget to leverage those first principles that you were taught and dig deep into the hardcore tech documentation whilst avoiding the garbage (YouTube/LinkedIn) influencer scene that's entertainment that seems useful, but is really just snacks and comfort food and therefore not very educational. Hands on keyboard > everything else.


===
I know that's a lot, so here's something more actionable:

At work, look at what your colleagues that are using different tech are doing and do some reading on that tech, then ask if you can sit with them for a few hours to understand how it works and how they use it. Then if you're ever in a position where you have to hand off work to someone else but they don't have the time, propose to your manager or team lead that you take care of the task instead to apply your knowledge and deliver value quicker than if you'd have to wait for the other team to have time. "That's not my job" should become something you physically can't say anymore.

In your spare time, make a spreadsheet that contains every tech you are comfortable with.  Categorize them and group things together, then look at the sheet and try to ensure you have experience with 3 technologies in each group. It doesn't matter which you learn to complete the categories, as long as you learn something; again you're not optimizing for job opportunities, you're optimizing for being able to learn quickly. But if you do get to prioritize or pick between things, try either something that's as wild and uncomfortable as possible (a new backend framework in an unfamiliar programming language for an operating system you've not used), or something your friends have experience with so you can discuss your experiences later (do NOT use them as a resource to ask questions to if you get stuck!!!!). Try to make something you need or want in life or something that aligns to a hobby or something you're super enthusiastic about; a hobby or passion is always the greatest focus for engineering velocity. If you don't have such a focus, just do things enjoy; work in your spare time should be fun so that you get excited to build stuff - the learnings are a side-effect. This strategy may be difficult, but you can always adjust later if needed.

Again, don't worry about which technology. It doesn't matter. Just learn things and be intentional about it.


===

You know why technology doesn't matter? 

Because in 10-15 years no potential employer will care about which frameworks you know. They want to know that you can apply technology - any technology - to solve their business problems. The only reason why people seem to care now is because you're junior and there's no expectation that you can do this right now, so a tech focus is a more convenient way to hire. 

But really, it's all about you being able to use things to solve things that align to business goals, and you being able to show and convince someone else you're good at that as part of a hiring process.


Here's another bit of advice: don't focus on your career when you're only a year in. Focus on doing good work and improving things. It's so much better to work underpaid at a shitty smaller company for 5+ years where there's lots of things to improve and room for you to fail but also make positive change, than it is to work invisibly for some larger corp with better compensation but no room to change things and fail (and learn) or grow. Don't accept a toxic workplace, though, so either quit your current workplace for anything else, or raise your concerns and work with your colleagues to affect change.
