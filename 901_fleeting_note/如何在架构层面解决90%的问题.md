[(583) 如何在架构层面解决90%的问题【让编程再次伟大#12】 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0688p1afBo&list=WL&index=6)
- make it async 
	- async means here is abt allow later proc no need to wait former proc to complete, in code, it mean using event emitter, job queue
			aysnc-await keyword in JS is a little differnent
				- when you use await, the underlying c++ code will use platfrom code(kqueue or epool) to IO Multiplexing ([note](https://www.notion.so/nture4388/I-O-Multiplexing-09abb445e68b4385a46359af544eda9d?pvs=4)) 
				- call it IO multiplexing means  1_thread can handle mutiple_socket
				- so nodeJS can handle high IO case, that what it good at
	- is also decouple the logic, later proc no need to wait former proc , and if job fail, don't affect the main logic
- ING...
