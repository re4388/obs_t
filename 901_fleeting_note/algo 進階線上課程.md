[Is anyone else taking Tim Roughgarden's course on algorithms in Coursera? : r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2t5nj2/is_anyone_else_taking_tim_roughgardens_course_on/)


Btw, here's a great post on the Coursera forum comparing the coursera algorithm classes:
1. Algorithms part 1 from Stanford: [https://class.coursera.org/algo-007](https://class.coursera.org/algo-007)
2. Algorithms part 1 from Princeton: [https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)
3. Analysis of Algorithms, also from Princeton: [https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa](https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa)
    

1.) Stanford - Pros:
- Tim is an engaging lecturer. You won't fall asleep and his proofs and explanations are top notch.
- The amount of material we will cover is great. By the end of the course you will have exposure to graph algorithms, which are fundamental to so many sciences now and the main reason I want to redo the course.
- The HW and optional theory problems are great.
    

Cons:
- While Tim does review data structures towards the end, if you've never seen them before or never seen them actually implemented in a language of your choice, this part of the course can become difficult. Tim lectures fairly high-level. Which in my opinion is great. But the lack of a concrete implementation was difficult last time around.
    
- The programming assignments are standard problems and I don't think develop your design and developer skills as much as the Princeton course.
    

2.) Princeton Part I. - Pros:
- The programming assignments. They are really great. Interesting problems and they specify an API that you must implement so it really makes you develop as you would in a professional setting adhering to an interface.
- The interview questions: Some are simple. Some are really difficult. But they are all fundamental and really test your knowledge.
- The lecture slides are really clean, the book is nice, and you don't really need to even watch the videos to understand a lot of the material.
    

Cons:
- Sedgewick is awesome. But I personally didn't like him reading off slides.
- The HW (not programming assignments) are not really of any substance.
    

3.) Princeton Analysis of Alg: Pros:
- You'll learn A LOT of math. Pure math. As in, you should be a very strong math student. You should smile upon hearing 'real analysis' and 'combinatorics'. I can't understate this. This is more a pure math class with a small emphasis on the applications to computer science topics.
    

Cons:

- The amount of math. If you're trying to go to graduate school in discrete mathematics or computer science, then by all means take this course. I like the Stanford course more.
- No programming assignments.
