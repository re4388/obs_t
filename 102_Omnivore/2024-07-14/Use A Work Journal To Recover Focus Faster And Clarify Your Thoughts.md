## Highlights

> The typical situation is that I start something, switch to something else, get into a meeting, forget the very essence of what I was doing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/use-a-work-journal-to-recover-focus-faster-and-clarify-your-thou-190af483ce6#c433ca0b-2dc9-43b4-b916-c2a0f3af5bd3)  ^c433ca0b

> I started listing all the commands I was running, and their results. Writing down my train of thoughts, the things I was doing and what I wanted to do next. And I have been doing that for the past 3-4 months. I feel like I invented something new. It helps me think more clearly, and restore the context so, so much faster when I switch between things. I’m almost looking forward to an interruption to get a chance to marvel again at my genius!

> They might be onto something. Write notes of what you’re doing and what you’re thinking. When you drop the pen and get back at it, read the last bit. That’s it.

> I’ve just been too lazy to ever do it. Or not necessarily lazy, but more: I didn’t trust the tool enough to think it was a good use of my time, and instead just mash on the keyboard till it works. After all, I’m writing pages of text, of which I will never read more than a fraction. But that’s not the point. The point is structure, and the point is caching.
