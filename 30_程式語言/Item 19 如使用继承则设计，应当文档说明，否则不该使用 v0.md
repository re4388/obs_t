Design and document for inheritance or else prohibitit



Item 18 alerted you to the dangers of subclassing a “foreign” class that was not designed and documented for inheritance. So what does it mean for a class to be designed and documented for inheritance?
如果你真的要繼承，你要有好的設計和文件

你要把 superclass overriding(覆寫) 的影響說清楚
First, the class must document precisely the effects of overriding any method. In other words, the class must document its self-use of overridable methods. For each public or protected method, the documentation must indicate which overridable methods the method invokes, in what sequence, and how the results of each invocation affect subsequent processing. (By overridable, we mean nonfinal and either public or protected.) More generally, a class must document any circumstances under which it might invoke an overridable method. For example, invocations might come from background threads or static initializers.



A method that invokes overridable methods contains a description of these invocations at the end of its documentation comment. The description is in a special section of the specification, labeled “Implementation Requirements,” which is generated by the Javadoc tag @implSpec. This section describes the inner workings of the method. Here’s an example, copied from the specification for java.util.AbstractCollection:

用javadoc 的  @implSpec tag
label 是  “Implementation Requirements,”
下面是一個例子:

This documentation leaves no doubt that overriding the iterator method will affect the behavior of the remove method. It also describes exactly how the behavior of the Iterator returned by the iterator method will affect the behavior of the remove method. Contrast this to the situation in Item 18, where the programmer subclassing HashSet simply could not say whether overriding the add method would affect the behavior of the addAll method.
這個文件有說清楚，如果你重寫iterator會發生什麼影響


But doesn’t this violate the dictum that good API documentation should describe what a given method does and not how it does it? Yes, it does! This is an unfortunate consequence of the fact that inheritance violates encapsulation. To document a class so that it can be safely subclassed, you must describe implemen- tation details that should otherwise be left unspecified.
一般來說， api doc 不應該要寫 how, 頂多寫 what, 更好是寫 why就好
但這邊基本上已經寫道 how
這就是使用繼承的成本

The @implSpec tag was added in Java 8 and used heavily in Java 9. This tag should be enabled by default, but as of Java 9, the Javadoc utility still ignores it unless you pass the command line switch -tag "apiNote:a:API Note:".



Designing for inheritance involves more than just documenting patterns of self-use. To allow programmers to write efficient subclasses without undue pain, a class may have to provide hooks into its internal workings in the form of judiciously chosen protected methods or, in rare instances, protected fields. For example, consider the removeRange method from java.util.AbstractList:

這個文件的目的是讓想要 subclass的人可以正確的使用
除了文件，你甚至要考慮提供 hook (via 保護函數)
看下面這個例子
![[IMG-Item 19 如使用继承则设计，应当文档说明，否则不该使用 v0-20241225153655773.png]]
see [[Java - removeRange 受保護方法]]

This method is of no interest to end users of a List implementation. It is provided solely to make it easy for subclasses to provide a fast clear method on sublists. In the absence of the removeRange method, subclasses would have to make do with quadratic performance when the clear method was invoked on sublists or rewrite the entire subList mechanism from scratch—not an easy task!



So how do you decide what protected members to expose when you design a class for inheritance? Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet. The best you can do is to think hard, take your best guess, and then test it by writing subclasses. You should expose as few protected members as possible because each one represents a commitment to an implementation detail. On the other hand, you must not expose too few because a missing protected member can render a class practically unusable for inheritance.
要如何決定要暴露哪些受保護方法?
太多 -> 暴露沒必要耦合的實作
太少 -> 很難用

The only way to test a class designed for inheritance is to write subclasses. If you omit a crucial protected member, trying to write a subclass will make the omission painfully obvious. Conversely, if several subclasses are written and none uses a protected member, you should probably make it private. Experience shows that three subclasses are usually sufficient to test an extendable class. One or more of these subclasses should be written by someone other than the superclass author.

你只能靠多寫 sublcass 來自己發現
更的的話，讓別人寫 subclass 更可以發現


When you design for inheritance a class that is likely to achieve wide use, realize that you are committing forever to the self-use patterns that you document and to the implementation decisions implicit in its protected methods and fields. These commitments can make it difficult or impossible to improve the performance or functionality of the class in a subsequent release. Therefore, you must test your class by writing subclasses before you release it.
你暴露的東西就是你未來承諾使用者的
如果很多人用，你基本上放棄了未來的優化和進一步調整
要很謹慎



Also, note that the special documentation required for inheritance clutters up normal documentation, which is designed for programmers who create instances of your class and invoke methods on them. As of this writing, there is little in the way of tools to separate ordinary API documentation from information of interest only to programmers implementing subclasses.
另外這個文件加上本來的 api 文件，文件也更複雜

There are a few more restrictions that a class must obey to allow inheritance. Constructors must not invoke overridable methods, directly or indirectly. If you violate this rule, program failure will result. The superclass constructor runs before the subclass constructor, so the overriding method in the subclass will get invoked before the subclass constructor has run. If the overriding method depends on any initialization performed by the subclass constructor, the method will not behave as expected. To make this concrete, here’s a class that violates this rule:

你的 super class 一定不可以在 ctor 呼叫 覆寫函數

當你實例 subclass 時，
superclass 的 ctor 會先呼叫，然後才是 subclass 的 ctor
但是你superclass 的 ctor裡面有 覆寫函數
這時候你的 subclass 還沒呼叫 ctor, 但是上面那個覆寫函數會呼叫 subclass 的覆寫函數


 
例子:

![[IMG-Item 19 如使用继承则设计，应当文档说明，否则不该使用 v0-20241225153655879.png]]


Here’s a subclass that overrides the overrideMe method, which is erroneously invoked by Super’s sole constructor:
![[IMG-Item 19 如使用继承则设计，应当文档说明，否则不该使用 v0-20241225153655984.png]]

You might expect this program to print out the instant twice, but it prints out null the first time because overrideMe is invoked by the Super constructor before the Sub constructor has a chance to initialize the instant field. Note that this program observes a final field in two different states! Note also that if overrideMe had invoked any method on instant, it would have thrown a NullPointerException when the Super constructor invoked overrideMe. The only reason this program doesn’t throw a NullPointerException as it stands is that the println method tolerates null parameters.

上面會先print null, 如果有被使用，就 null ptr exception了
因為 superclass 的 ctor 裡面的覆寫會呼叫 suclass 

但是這時候 sbclass 還沒 ctor, 因此instance 還是空的

因此就是 instance 就是 null

因為 printLn 可以吃null, 不然這邊就噴了



Note that it is safe to invoke private methods, final methods, and static methods, none of which are overridable, from a constructor.

ctor 可以呼叫私有，最終，靜態等函數，但視覺不要呼叫 覆寫函數




The Cloneable and Serializable interfaces present special difficulties when designing for inheritance. It is generally not a good idea for a class designed for inheritance to implement either of these interfaces because they place a sub- stantial burden on programmers who extend the class. There are, however, special actions that you can take to allow subclasses to implement these interfaces without mandating that they do so. These actions are described in Item 13 and Item 86.

If you do decide to implement either Cloneable or Serializable in a class that is designed for inheritance, you should be aware that because the clone and readObject methods behave a lot like constructors, a similar restriction applies: neither clone nor readObject may invoke an overridable method, directly or indirectly. In the case of readObject, the overriding method will run before the subclass’s state has been deserialized. In the case of clone, the overriding method will run before the subclass’s clone method has a chance to fix the clone’s state. In either case, a program failure is likely to follow. In the case of clone, the failure can damage the original object as well as the clone. This can happen, for example, if the overriding method assumes it is modifying the clone’s copy of the object’s deep structure, but the copy hasn’t been made yet.

Finally, if you decide to implement Serializable in a class designed for inheritance and the class has a readResolve or writeReplace method, you must make the readResolve or writeReplace method protected rather than private. If these methods are private, they will be silently ignored by subclasses. This is one more case where an implementation detail becomes part of a class’s API to permit inheritance.

上面這段是在說，如果你的 super class 要實作  Cloneable and Serializable interfaces
上面需要留意

請看 Item 13 and Item 86.

clone and readObject 函數跟 ctor 很像，因此 neither clone nor readObject may invoke an overridable method, directly or indirectly.

另外如果  the class has a readResolve or writeReplace method, you must make the readResolve or writeReplace method protected rather than private. 不然會被 subclass 無視掉



By now it should be apparent that designing a class for inheritance requires great effort and places substantial limitations on the class. This is not a decision to be undertaken lightly. There are some situations where it is clearly the right thing to do, such as abstract classes, including skeletal implementations of interfaces (Item 20). There are other situations where it is clearly the wrong thing to do, such as immutable classes (Item 17).

總之，盡量不要繼承，很多成本。
還是有可以用的時候，類似抽象類，或是 skeletal implementations of interfaces (Item 20)

也有絕不要用的時候，像是  immutable classes (Item 17)



But what about ordinary concrete classes? Traditionally, they are neither final nor designed and documented for subclassing, but this state of affairs is dangerous. Each time a change is made in such a class, there is a chance that subclasses extending the class will break. This is not just a theoretical problem. It is not uncommon to receive subclassing-related bug reports after modifying the internals of a nonfinal concrete class that was not designed and documented for inheritance.

一直以來都有持續有 bug 是因為 super class 的調整導致 subclass 壞掉的例子


The best solution to this problem is to prohibit subclassing in classes that are not designed and documented to be safely subclassed. There are two ways to prohibit subclassing. The easier of the two is to declare the class final. The alternative is to make all the constructors private or package-private and to add public static factories in place of the constructors. This alternative, which provides the flexibility to use subclasses internally, is discussed in Item 17. Either approach is acceptable.

如果沒有設計和文件好，就不要 subclass
兩個方法禁止 subclass
- 加上 final
- 把ctor變成私有和包私有，用靜態工廠取代ctor 
第二個方法更老，因為你更有彈性，看 item17


This advice may be somewhat controversial because many programmers have grown accustomed to subclassing ordinary concrete classes to add facilities such as instrumentation, notification, and synchronization or to limit functionality. If a class implements some interface that captures its essence, such as Set, List, or Map, then you should feel no compunction about prohibiting subclassing. The wrapper class pattern, described in Item 18, provides a superior alternative to inheritance for augmenting the functionality.

很多人都很習慣用繼承，用繼承來達到  instrumentation, notification, and synchronization or to limit functionality
不過如果你的類是跟上面那個例子類似，就是要拿類似  Set, List, or Map 的功能，你不應該猶豫，應該直接用上面的 wrapper class pattern, described in Item 18


If a concrete class does not implement a standard interface, then you may inconvenience some programmers by prohibiting inheritance. If you feel that you must allow inheritance from such a class, one reasonable approach is to ensure that the class never invokes any of its overridable methods and to document this fact. In other words, eliminate the class’s self-use of overridable methods entirely. In doing so, you’ll create a class that is reasonably safe to subclass. Overriding a method will never affect the behavior of any other method.

如果類真的沒有要實作 interface, 你又禁止繼承，那這個類可能的確不好用。
那你可以確保不要讓這個類自己去使用任何覆寫方法, 這樣會安全的多。


You can eliminate a class’s self-use of overridable methods mechanically, without changing its behavior. Move the body of each overridable method to a private “helper method” and have each overridable method invoke its private helper method. Then replace each self-use of an overridable method with a direct invocation of the overridable method’s private helper method.
如何確保不要讓這個類自己去使用任何覆寫方法？
你把每一個可以被覆寫的方法的body都移動到 private helperMethod
然後你讓每一個 被覆寫的方法 呼叫這些 private helperMethod
然後你把哪些你本來會去呼叫自己覆寫方法的地方，改為呼叫這些 private helperMethod


In summary
- designing a class for inheritance is hard work. You must document all of its self-use patterns, and once you’ve documented them, you must commit to them for the life of the class. 
- If you fail to do this, subclasses may become dependent on implementation details of the superclass and may break if the implementation of the superclass changes. 
- To allow others to write efficient subclasses, you may also have to export one or more protected methods. 
- Unless you know there is a real need for subclasses, you are probably better off prohibiting inheritance by declaring your class final or ensuring that there are no accessible constructors.
