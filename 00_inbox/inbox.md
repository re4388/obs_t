# 💭 thoughts

healthy condition affect my proactivity a log given my already not-active enough default

- [x]  soul asking urself what u like and what u don't like

- use eng or chinese to note?
	- use english is sometimes good is cuz its faster to type then chinese and it can keep my mind keep thiniking, this is a good thing.
	- but english (also Chinese can have s.t.) is you will note down what you don't really know.
		- by really know, what i mean is that you know it from first principle, you can explain it to your wife or 5 yr old kid

cache error -> due to test case is not think thru, or lazy to skip obvious cache logic and this is where I made the stupid mistake
- lesson? 
- deon't skip the obvious simple test -> which may have blind spot and if you write it wrong, you got a stupid mistake
- the mistake happen when you later move the code, and since you don't have stupid test in place, you break the code



## recent thoughts and good quotes and sentences
- try to write down everything when you're working, thinking  1) make thoughts more orgniza 2) switch context more esily
	- [[Use A Work Journal To Recover Focus Faster And Clarify Your Thoughts]]
- How to design and plan? Begin with Use Case 
	- related to : [[Don't get too lost in the weeds.]] aka: 不重要的事情，做的在好，也是不重要的
	- [[core system 功能規劃記錄]]
- 要思考要如何用
- when you learn stuff, you need to know what you want to use, use it and then you know
	- o.w. you become kind-of know -> but you don't even have 實作經驗, 一次也沒有
	- 一次也沒有的實作經驗-> 讓你未來有機會可以運用的機會很小
	- 因為你比較想是 "看過人家做一次"(看人家的 code)
	- 不然你就要很自覺的知道，你只是看過人家的code
	- 下一個階段就是實作看看
	- 最後才可以常常運用
	- 這樣才會變成你的 LEGO
- Take ownership, do not blame other
- 學什麼？困難的具體的真實需求。 [[learn_idx]]

- cut your Ostrich Mentality, be Brave
- writing, speaking and programming -> 力求清晰 (clarity) [[rule10 說話要精準]]
- It is not abt FAST,**is abt if you do take the time to think/ponder/consider to check and evaluate if this is the best way to do things** , and this can make outcome better and not waste time (by which you need to fix it)
