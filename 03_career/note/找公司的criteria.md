溝通以前，我可以先了解以下幾個事情嗎？這樣可以更有效率的加速進行和先快速確認彼此的預期喔！ 
1. 請問可以先了解公司對此職位的預期薪水範圍？ 
2. 請問此職位的公司工作地點(我有查一下公司網站地址，但想要確定一下XD)？ remote允許的情況? 
3. 請問公司對此職業的招募程序？ 感謝～～ 




May I have some info by which I think can save us a lot of time :) For this position: 1. Can I have a idea about what is the expected package? salary range by month or by year? 2. Is a remote position? If not, where I am actually need to be working at? 3. What is the recruiting process? Thanks a lot :)

- remote 問問看情況，無法的話，太遠要砍掉
- 問一下薪水 salary expect 1.3 Million NTD+ annual
- 問一下公司文化 foreign company/culture - most industries are fine except gambling -> 除非200%確定零風險
- 了解公司招募程序




### Lance share
- company policy?
	- remote?
	- what can I learn from this company?
	- coco is okay?
	- align with my interest?
	- is this work can put me in a better postion when I am looking for the next work?
	- do we have skilled people inside that I can learn from?
	- if this is a small company, how about its future? if it's a big company, how about the project future?

Below are some good points if this company has:
- foreign company or foreigh culture for Taiwan company
- location: 
- since I don't want to spend more than 30 min on commute
- remote is best, or not that far to my home
- (maybe focus on remote can be a good beinign)
- backend
- I am proficeit in english speaking as well, so if company require this, that's a win-win for both side
- 130+



## now
- foreign culture
- speak Eng
- non-remote but my boss is kind enough to let me full-remove if we still have covid cases
- full-stack
- around 80-90

  

## career target
- foreign culture
- speak english
- full remote
- 技術想要換另外一套 like mirco service or distbuteied sys
- full-stack & backend
- 110~120
- good pratice (use unit test and code review process to check)
	- find company which have this kind of practice
	- very emphisis code review process
	- very emphaisis unit test
	- those are key factor to know what a good compnay it is
	- and this is the company you need to look for
	- you can only learn solid coding practice during your next company expreice and those are you experience asset
	- (otherwise, you just accsulate bad habits and waste years)
