lesson:
why use ec2 not lambda
lambda got time min limit -> can't handle
not only 5 - 6 api, we have 20, 30 api
too much lamnda to manage, put them in to a server to handle and inside ec2

better to have a speicif exp to talk about

=> imporvement pt:
- you need to have ability to talk about one particular tehinical chellenge deep and detail enough
