- take out the nvim ns-ll stuff -> replace my cosmic
- 

- bookmark function
	-  idea to do this tool?
		- 跟用現在一樣的邏輯...
			- each file is a key-val
			- fileName is key, content is val
			- fzf cna help thru key
			- 不同的地方是: when I hit the choosen one, it will display the code content
			- add logic
				- it is basically create a file with a content
				- when I add an input, i need to provide the fileName (還車 in hermes) (since I need to find repo to search, it's better to also provide the repo name) and content
	- how I use this tool?
		- step1: use my memory to use keyword search: like 還車 / return, search only in key
		- the tool will use this keyword to seach all key and find 還車 or return 
		- when I see its detail, I can see the code snippet
		- I can use this code snippet to alt+s code base
	- bookmark structure
		- key
		- code snippet
	- add bookmark
		- I will select something in code -> stuff goes into clipboard
		- I use this prog use add
			- it will auto get the stuff from the clipboard ans save it into the list
	- remove bookmark
		- l
	- list all bookmark
	- search for all bookmark
		- can fuzzy search the entire bookmark list
		- first step: 手動
			- I goes into a repo, use intelliJ alt+s to search by myself


- try vim-entire
	- 2024-02-07目前 考慮先drop,  don't wana take so many time working on in-mature IDE for now OR the IDE not my main and even second IDE (IDEA and code)
	- 可能要思考本來的 kana 要如何整入nvim? or lazy vim not support
	- nvim 有幾個套件，都需要調才可以用, not plug and play
		- nvim 的一個缺點就是無法 plug and play XD
	- sol candidate:
		- use nvim package and update its param, maybe easy
		- use another package mgmt, like my old pjt need -> but wierd
		- do not solve, just try to remember how to choose all? (ggVG -> d/c/y)
	


- xy problem
	- 你一開始要解決 x, 然後用 y 方法，y 方法卡住
	- 你問別人 how to solve y
		- and sometimes, even you and other spend a lot of time to solve y, y is not really can solve your x
		- you need to address x directly
	- maybe you just choose the y wrongly
	- sometimes youself also mistken on this


	- example
		- say x is anout making more money
		- and you have 2 solution
			- be a capable worker -> ask more money
				- this is invalid if the company is just not earn much
				- this is invlaid if the industry by which the company in is not that profit
				- this is invlaid... you get the idea
				- ....how be a capbable worker is
   - how to solve?
	   - keep note on this kind of problem
	   - and use note to reminder yourslef -> what's the origin problem..
